Fix save files to include obj description, then only need on random number
    generator which can use table program
Replace magic numbers with constants
Name objects if use did not identify them
Add a pull-back map command like the PC version, display entire map on screen
    only showing important features, like stairs

Very hard things to add:
Recenter character on screen?
Can't look in any direction, only in the 8 directions
Can't case in any direction

Long term stuff, enhancement suggestions:
Give player something to do with money, i.e. 1 Milltion gp for a HA +10 +10 sword
'Flavor' the levels, dragons on one level, undead on another, etc.
What's been discovered list
Use environment variables to specify rogue-like/original keys
Use environment variables for default save filename
Commands not close enough to rogue style
Fixed item lettering in inventory, in-line/cmd-line options?
Scoreboard to have all scores, not top twenty
Command line option to print out times open
Can't drop, identify, pick up, or throw items in equipment list
Y destroy command, allow destroy from equipment list
Let o, c, D commands automatically pick direction when they can
Give rogue's a chance to steal, e.g. let monsters carry items that they pick up
Give magic users a change an pre-identifying scrolls
Could use a help system, like VMS version
Make scroll of identify more common, to help non-MU character classes

Features:
Hero/Superhero do not subtract hitpoints when effect wears off
WOR scroll can save you with minus hitpoints!!
Detect monster does not detect invisible mosters (normally)
Can hit monsters in walls, but can not cast at them
Can not enchant something with negative numbers (i.e. cursed items)
How does armor protect against breath/gas? It doesn't!!!
Run stops one character before room lights, because it is supposed to
