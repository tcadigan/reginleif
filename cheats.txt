To use a cheat code while playing Gladiator, hold down the "cheat key" for your
player, and press an associated key.

The following standard cheat codes are currently supported:

Cheat key for player 1 is F5 (2 is F6, 3 is F7, and 4 is F8); these may by
changed by using the "key preferences" option from the options menu (press *).

Cheat key +:
     F: Gain flight
     H: Gain hitpoints
     M: Gain magic points
     S: Gain temporary movement speed increase
     T: Transform to another character type
     V: Gain invisibility
   [,]: (left and right brackets) Temporarily lower or raise your level
   F12: Kill all LIVING enemies on the level
switch: (character switch) Switch to a character on an opposing team, if
        available

Thus, to give yourself, as player 1, more hitpoints, you would hold down F5 and
press the H key.

To cheat while in the character picker, go to the "Hire Team". Then hold down
the Control key and press the "+" key on the numeric keypad; this will increase
your available money quite quickly. You can also lower your money by pressing
the minus ("-") key instead.
