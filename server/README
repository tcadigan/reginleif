                Galactic Bloodshed (GB+) server README file

                         Michael Wilkinson (03/05)



If you're not familiar with GB, please read the INTRO file. You should
read everything in here before trying to run the game. If at-all possible
you should participate in a game before trying to run one.


SUMMARY

My first GB games was back in 1991 and I played it over a 1200bps modem,
I was daring enough to run my own game by 1995. I have been a fan since
I played by first game (and lost horribly).

You must understance there has been many flavors of GB over the years, and
even more code contributors. Originally there was GB; from this spun several
different flavors of GB. Many God plyers made their own mods, however, most
of these mods did not continue along the main tree (being instead unique to
the particular game), these modes were HAP, MarVin, Balanced Treehouse, Jekyll
& Hyde, and Vengence of Solkan. However, development along the main line
continued through the GB+ versions. Finally, after a period of inactivity GB+
was renewed by some Finnish students under their own mod, HUT. HUT had some
major bug fixes and additions so, for coding purposes, I have considered it
part of the main development line. Here's a sort of time-line:

        Year  Main    Mod
        ----  ----    ---
        1989  GB
               |
        1991   |----> Heuristic Astronomy Project (HAP)
        1992  GB+
        1993   |----> MarVin
        1994   |----> Balanced Treehouse
               |
        1997  HUT
        1998   |----> Jekyll & Hyde
        1999   |----> Vengeance of Solkan (VoS)
               |
        2005  GB+ (6.0)

I've gone back through time and collected each of these source trees (the
main ones and the mods), painstakingly picked through each one, and using
HUT-5.1.1 as my starting point, I've included all of the unique features of
each source tree. Because HUT was really a mod of GB+, I've gone back to
that name. And to indicate that HUT was a starting point, and because I've
made about a maxillion changes, this version will be 6.0. A lower-case letter
following the version number indicates the bug fix leve. So this new main
development tree is starting as GB+ 6.0a. Welcome!

DIRECTORIES

bin - This directory is created at install, you should add it to your PATH.

hdrs, utils, user, server - Directories containing the GB+ server source
code. If you're a code hacker, and are interested in modifying GB, you'll
want to get to know the files in these directories. If you don't know C or
don't have a desire to learn it, you probably don't want to be in these
directories.

Docs - contains some documents on GB, most of the stuff in here is out-of-
date, however, it's privded for historical reasons. Refer to my time-line
above so you'll know how these documents relate to each-other.

Help - These are the help files for the GB server that will be presented to
the user. You should read these, they are up-to-date. Particularly if you're
new to managing a GB game you should read admin.txt and the files it
references.

misc - Misc files used during the game, particularly you'll probably want to
modify welcome.txt and motd.txt for your game. The bugrep.txt file contains
bugs reported by users during the course of the game.

Logs - This is where the GB server logs and pid files go. Look here for errors.

Backups - You game directories are backed up according to a backup schedule.
This is where the tar files are dated and stored during the course of a game.

Data, Msgs, News - Game directories, created by 'makeuniv'. This is all your
vital game data.


SETUP

1. Run the 'Configure' script. This asks information about your environment
   and options you want for the game.

2. Edit hdrs/game_info.h and change the information for your game.

3. (optional) Look at hdrs/tweakables.h see if there's anything in there you
    want to change. Only experienced GB folk should be in this file.

4. Run a 'make' and address any errors.

5. Do a 'make install'. This puts all executables in the bin directory. You
   should have this directory in your PATH.

6. Execute the 'makeuniv' command. This asks you a series of questions to help
   you set up your GB universe. When done this will have created the Data,
   News, and Msgs game directories.

7. Start up the 'GB_racegen' program and create your God player and enroll
   it. You should also consider creating a Guest player at this point.

8. Finally, fire up the daemon processes with 'gbctl start'. This will start
   the GB_guardian, GB_server, and GB_racegen daemons. You can connect to
   the GB_server on the port you specified when running 'Configure' (default
   port 2010). The GB_racegen is runnong on a port 10 higher than the server
   port (default 2020).


CONNECTING

You'll need a client to connect to the GB server, I recommend gbII, it's
available where you downloaded GB+. However, gbII is for Unix (and Linux),
and although that's not a problem for you, some of your players may not have
a Unix box. There was a GB client for PC (gbpc), but I've never used it and
don't know where you can find it now. If you've compiled using the CHAP
authentication, only the gbII client (2.6) will work with it.

There has been considerable work done on getting gbII to compile under the
Cygwin environment. In fact, an installer has been created that will allow
PC users to install and run gbII under Windows without requiring Cygwin.
Look for this installer on SourceForge under the Galactic Bloodshed Project.

As an alternative you may compile gbII in restricted mode and provide it on
a restricted account on your Unix box.

Once you log in you should read all the help pages, particularly the
'help admin' section and all pages it references.


USERS

Although the group is now mostly crap-spam, you should post the announcement
of your game to alt.games.gb, this is the official USENET newsgroup, and some
of us old-timers still read it. On the group post about your game, how to
connect to the guest account and how to connect to the racegen.

When enrolling races using GB_racegen, you should first stop the GB server
with 'gbctl stop'. Then enroll the races, then 'gbctl start'. This will
prevent database overwrites.


FINALLY

If you have any questions, comments, complaints, criticisms and/or kudus
please email me.
