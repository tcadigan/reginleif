Here is how the new repair of ships works:

In order to repair x% damage on your ship you need:
  0.005 * x * (cost of ship)
resources on it. If you have those a maximum of 50% of damage will be repaired
in one turn. If you have less, the damage repairs will be proportionally
decreased. After having calculated how much repair you can afford, the program
checks how much crew you have to do it. Again, a fully populated ship will
repair at a maximum rate, with proportional decreases when you have fewer
people.

In order to make this feasible, the cargo capacity of the ships has been
increased by 1/2 the cost of the ship. This means you can repair 100% of the
damage (of course you can't repair a destroyed ship) before reloading.

Sometime in the future, I will set the repair such that a random percentage of
damage is inflicted automatically each turn (0-5%). This damage is due to normal
wear and tear. You will have to stockpile your ships sufficiently in order to
keep them in shape and you will have to resupply them when you send them half
across the galaxy. Right now this would be tedious, so I will implement a
'reful' command, which will 'beam' resources, destruct and fuel between two
ships within 500 distance units. It will automatically load 100% of resources,
100% of fuel and 100% of dest from one ship to the other. Wait for news on this
it is not operational yet.

Good luck.
