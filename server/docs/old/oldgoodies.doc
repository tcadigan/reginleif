well, HOW we define the capabilities of a ship WILL determine how they
are used in combat. i personally feel that fighters should rule a system.
it must take a well prepared attack to conquer. if a B or and S or what
are 'too vulnerable' to a massive fighter attack, then so be it.
bring in your own fighers and attack the other fighters. we have not
had this happen, because everyone favours a top heavy fleet
(all brute strength, no supports). if this is the way things are to be
then we end up with a lot of wasted code and anything else becomes
irrelevant (10 B's in favour of 50 f's).

R. Chansky agrees with me. we want people to be creative, not just building
B's and S's to win a battle. (his original idea of a space station was
a vulnerable military installation, not a megolithic attack weapon).

i suggest you talk to him personally via mail
smq@ucscb.ucsc.edu

even though he is kind of buys, he is interested in everyone's
ideas.

btw, if you like the idea of big ships, don't fuck with VN's too
much (surprise weapon, the BERSERKERS! are being programmed by him
- these VN's begin to build D's if you attack them after a while,
there is a way to stop them though - a secret for now).


what i am trying to do is not write code which dictates how to
win a battle or a system or what not, i want players to be able to
try out many different avenues of attack, many which may be completed
different than the other. each player has the ability to decide how he wants to
arm his fleet.

i believe that speed, vulnerability, and what not must come into play.
however, talking about the 'accuracy' of a weapon traveling half the
distance of the solar system has to be seriously taken into consideration.
each target can be. fine. does this assume that the targeted ship doesn't
have tricks of their own (decoys, EW warfare, or what not). the
advantage must NOt be in favor of the attacker. i am convinced that
the range dependencies of the effectiveness of an attack are worthy.
otherwise, we don't have a game of guts but a game of numbers.

each ship combat ship should have their advantages as well as disadvantages.
and the game shouldn't go

d -> C -> B -> D.

the availability of them should, but the eeffectiveness of them should
remain consistent. to say that when you can start building B's the C's
are obsolete takes them out of the game.

i think 3 or 4 C's should be able to take a B out.

1941, the great Bismark was destroyed in 1 shot by the H.M.S Hood
( a battle cruiser). according the system you guys want, this hsould NEVER HAPPEN.

war is not that scientific. anybody that believes it is sadly mistaken.


i think that a well planned f attack should be able to cripple a S.
note the phrase "well planned". not numbers, well planned.

without this, the game is a lot like Risk which i personally find
uninteresting, the oddss go in favor of the attacker.

i think a player should have at least 3 or 4:1 odds to be assured a
victory. period. history of war bears this as being true!

not that a 1:1 or at 2:1 attack, or a 1:2 or less for that matter, can't
be successful, but the way things are set up, if you have an advantage
of 2:1 or even 1.25:1 you can be ASSURED of victory.

the way things are set up, people who are even slightly behind give up
because they KNOW they stand no chance.
