               THE STANFORD CONVENTION OF VICTORY CONDITIONS
               =============================================

THE RULES:
==========

  1) Victory conditions are based on the control of systems a system is
     controlled by a block, if all occupied sectors belong to members of the
     block at that turn.

  2) Each block gets 10 Victory Points (VPs) for every system it holds every
     turn.

  3) The block which satisfies the following conditions for at least ten
     consecutive updates will be declared the victor.

       a) A block must control 1 / 2 + n / 24 of all systems (where n = the
          number of members in the block).

       b) A block must have acquired 100% more victory points than any other
          block, plus the block must control an additional 10% per block member
          more points than any other block.

          For example, block 8 (10,000 Maniacs) has 7 members; therefore they
          must acquire 170% more victory points than any other block.

       c) All of a block's members must have acquired a tech over 200.

THE MOTIVIATION:
================

Ah, the sweet smell of Victory! We all long for it; we all long to taste it, but
none of us really knew what it was.

Oh, we had a vague idea. One block totally dominating the entire galaxy. All
other blocks merely crushed and worthless shells of biomass, but unfortunately,
Galactic Bloodshed lives in the precise realm of numbers and logic, and while we
might long for the more flowery and literary description of victory, the
environment demands a formula. So I hereby present the Stanford Convention.

When looking for victory conditions, I wanted to find a situation based upon the
familiar notion of 10 VP's per controlled system that would accurately portray
that literary notion of victory that we all knew in our hearts.

So I made the requirements for victory more strict than before, and I based a
'neutral time period' where no one could achieve victory on tech levels.

Furthermore, while basing the victory condition on block size, I feel two
interesting situation will develop. One, the alliance of convenience, where a
block is formed merely to keep another block from winning. Which leads to, the
Post-Alliance situation, where a large block must break up in order to achieve
victory.

Well, I've rambled enough. These victory conditions are far from set in stone,
so feel free to make suggestions on them.
