LIST OF FIXED PROBLEMS

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
makeuniv creates odd universum.                                            Fixed
---

dest + fuel crashes the server.                                            Fixed

1) order #ship dest #ship2
2) fuel #ship /Planet
----->> server crashes
---

Crazy morale generating after ground combats.                              Fixed
---

Fuel bug order jump tells different amount of fuel           Comment "Jump needs
just needs than it actually does.                            'at least' NN fuel
                                                             to jump" added

Two reasons here. One is no bug...Planets move before
jump happens so distance is slightly different.
Another one: calculations don't take account of
hanger ships fuel. (maybe nor resos or dest either?)
---

Insurgency is not working                                                  Fixed
---

Adventurism is working odd.                                                Fixed
---

Test1 and Test2 systems.                                                   Fixed

Remove those.
---

Ghost planets/stars                                                        Fixed

Sometimes one system and/or planet appears to have
no name.
---

Game corrupts when someone tries to build ship                             Fixed
number above available 64K

Checking that there is ship numbers available before
building a new ship.
---

Crazy number of sectors                                                    Fixed

Note here: this happens when you load crew in ship
and no population is left on that sector...in this
case number of your sectors is decreased by one.
This happens even if you didn't own that sector in
first place. This affects negative number of
sectors (and turns it to 64K)
---

[ is 50% damaged when build.                                               Fixed

Should be 48%
---

Distance                                                                   Fixed

You can find out number of planets in system by
asking distance between known thing and suspected
planet.
---

Wrong message is shown when assaulting w.                                  Fixed

"Boarders are unable to control the pod."
---

Terraformers autoscrap themselves when there is                            Fixed
work for T to do.
---

Terraformers autoscrap without setting autoscrap.                          Fixed
---

You get warning when someone terraforms your                               Fixed
sectors, but warning doesn't include planet
where this is happening.
---

Mines crashes the server
---

Mines are not working.                                                     Fixed

When enemy ship enters triggers radius all attack
messages are shown, but nothing actually happens
to mine or target.
---

Another mine bug.                                                          Fixed

Mine will never disappear, not matter disperse
settings. (This could be part of the problem
above).
---

Creating destruction.                                                      Fixed

You can easily create 65K dest. Leave on dest
inside ship that uses planetary stockpile and one
dest in stockpile. Now shoot larger salvo than 2.
Number of dest in stockpile becomes negative and
turns to 65K.

Bad features                                                        Who will fix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You don't need to be in scope in question when you                         Fixed
give ships to your ally.

This way you can spend less important APs.
---

Military digs resos and rise eff.                                          Fixed

I don't think they should.
---

Still some documents imcomplete and grammatical                            Tapsa
errors and types.

They probably always will be somewhat, but I'm
doing my best.

Please report all errors you find to:
  rauta@alpha.hut.fi
---

Morale generating by number of sectors.                                    Fixed

Decreased to 1/10th of what it is now.
---

Too huge max global AP amount.                                             Fixed

1023 ---> 511
---

Stockpile use for Y and K                                     Feature documented
                                                              and warnings added

Y and K work before planet produces. This makes
problems if Y and K are using stockpile. Changing
this order could be a good idea.
---

Missile impact default                                                     Fixed

Missiles are ordered to impact 0,0 as default.
This is stupid. Default should be scatter.
---

Factory activating.                                                        Fixed

Factory can be activated even if it is not ordered
to make any specific ship. When using this factory
it will create just new factories.
---

Rank of general is required to give command 'name'                         Fixed
---

Captain syntax                                                             Fixed

command promote requires syntax:
  promote <gov> captain

command appoint requires syntax:
  appoint <gov> <passwrd> captain

when typing just appoint, printing is:
  1  password CAPTAIN ACTIVE

When you try to give the captain commands with lower gov you
receive:
  The "xxx" command requires a minimum level of captain to running

All document talks about
  captain
---

Center command                                                             Fixed

Novice can not give command 'center'.
---

Planetary guns shoots landing ships even if planet                         Fixed
is enslaved.
---

Military is not counted as garrison when calculating                       Fixed
stability of enslave.

you need to leave 0.1% of planet's population amount
of garrison to keep enslaved planet under your control.
But this garrison needs to be women and children...
military won't do. So error is that 0.1% calculations.
It should use (num_pop + num_mil) instead of (num_pop).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planet doubling bug
---

Needed governor rankings reasonabilized.
---

Too much alike system names removed (like no more
Taurus, Tardus and Tarsus)
---

Unable to use shipsign when using multiship commands
if shipnumber higher than you try to use is destroyed
in scope in question.

Example: You can't load dest into missiles 10000-10100
with using command 'load ^ dest' before next segment if
you have scrapped ground telescope i8000 in the same
scope.
---

Typos in code.
---

Fuel calculation bug.
---

Shipmass miscalculation bug.
---

Numerous of others
