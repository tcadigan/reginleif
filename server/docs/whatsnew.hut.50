dest + fuel crashes the server.                                            Fixed

1) order #ship dest #ship2
2) fuel #ship /Planet

Crazy morale generating after ground combats.                              Fixed

Fuel bug order jump tells different amount of fuel          Comment "Jump needs
just needs than it actually does.                           'at least' NN fuel

Two reasons here. One is no bug...planets move before
jump happens so distance is slightly different.
Another one: calculations don't take account of mass
hanger ships fuel. (maybe nor resos or dest either?)

Insurgency is not working                                                  Fixed

---

Crazy number of sectors                                                    Fixed

Note here: This happens when you load crew in ship
and no population is left on that sector...in this
case number of your sectors is decreased by one.
This happens even if you don't own that sector in
the first place. This affects negative number of
sectors (and turns it to 64K).

Fix here is simple. Prevent 'load crew' and maybe
'load mil' commands you don't own sector where ship
is landed.
---

[ is 50% damaged when built.                                               Fixed

you can find out number of planets in system by
asking distance between known thing and suspected
planet.

Mines crash the server
---

Mines are not working.                                                     Fixed

When enemy ship enters trigger radius all attack
messages are shown, but nothing actually happens
to mine or target.
---

Another mine bug.                                                          Fixed

Mine will never disappear, nor matter disperse
settings. (This could be part of the problem
above).
---

Creating destruction.                                                      Fixed

You can easily create 65K dest. Leave one dest
inside ship that uses planetary stockpile and one
dest in stockpile. Not shoot larger salvo than 2.
Number of dest in stockpile becomes negative and
turns to 65K.

You don't need to be in scope in question when you                         Fixed

This way you can spend less important APs.

I don't think they should.

Still some documents incomplete and grammatical                            Tapsa

Y and K work before planet produces. This makes
problems if Y and K are using stockpile. Changing
this order could be a good idea.
---

Missile impact default.                                                    Fixed

Missiles are ordered to impact 0,0 as default.
This is stupid. Default should be scatter.
---

Factory activating.                                                        Fixed

Factory can be activated even if it is not ordered
to make any specific ship. When using this factory
it will create just new factories.

Captain syntax                                                             Fixed

Command promote requires syntax:
  promote  captain

command appoint requires syntax:
  appoint  captain

when typing just appoint, printing is:
  1  password  CAPTAIN  ACTIVE

When you try to give captain commands with lower gov you
receive:
  The "xxx" command requires a minimum level of captain to run

All document talks about
  captain

center command                                                             Fixed

Planetary guns shoots landing ships even if planet                         Fixed
is enslaved.
---

Military is not counted as garrisons when calculating                      Fixed
stability of enslave.

You need to leave 0.1% of planet's population amount
of garrison to keep enslaved planet under your control.
But this garrison needs to be women and children...
military won't do. So error is that 0.1% calculations.
It should use (num_pop + num_mil) instead of (num_pop).

What is still wrong with GB 5.0 HUT code

---
Nothing left. All known bugs and bad features are fixed.
---

Official HUT GB release 5.1 will be available soon as we run little
testings. Approximate date 1.10.

Terraformers, Plows and Domes

there are some neat changes in TKY ships in HUT 5.0 code. Those changes are
basically aimed to make GB easier or at least less time consuming to play. New
features in HUT 5.0 are:
  * Auto-moving TKY's (hop)
  * Auto-scraping TK's
  * Stockpile usage

Auto-movement (hopping)

TKY's are now moving themselves once they consider their job done in sector they
are landed. They will move to the most suitable sector to continue their
job. Command 'order limit n' could be used to control their decision to move and
command 'order hop [on|off]' could be used to turn auto-movement on or off.

Terraformers will terraform the sector they are landed on in one segment so
'limit n' setting is used to control the selection of the next sector to
terraform: value n (in percent) will limit their activity to sectors that have
compatibility less than n% for your race. So if you have compatibilities 100% of
land and 70% for water you should give 'order T limit 70' to prevent water
sectors from being terraformed. T's will 1st look if there is suitable target
sector that you own if not unowned sectors are searched. If T hops to unowned
sector that sector will be randomly chosen to prevent other players to predict
where your T is going to be after update. NOTE: You can still T's move orders -
move orders will be evaluated first and then auto-hop so using move and hop at
same time could lead to quite confusing results.

Space plows will do auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has higher
fertility than their limit setting. As with T's player's own sectors are
preferred and old move code is still working. K's will hop to sector that has
lowest fertility (even if it is higher than its limit setting - so you could
give 'order K limit 1', K's will hop in every update but your planet will end up
100% fert in each sector) if all player's own sectors has 100% fert K's will
hope to any sector that has any compatibility and has lowest fert. If there are
more than one sector that has minimum fertility value target sector will be
chosen by random.

Domes will auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has higher efficiency than
their limit setting is. They will hop only to player's own sectors. Sector of
lowest eff is chosen and if there is more than one sector with same eff target
will be chosen by random.

Auto-scraping

TK's will not autoscrap as Y's if autoscrap and hop are set on and there is no
suitable target sector to hop. NOTE: autoscrap order has now on/off setting
i.e. 'order YKT autoscrap [on|off]', autoscrap without on/off will work as it
did earlier GB versions.

Stockpile usage

TKY's will now use planetary stockpile so basically you don't have to load res
of fuel or use threshloading with them - they'll just take everything they need
from stockpile. Anyhow because they operate before production cycle in updates
you should look after that there is enough resources for _all_ landed ships that
use stockpile (or you could just use threshloading which is easier I
think). This one thing which might be done other way i.e. planetary production
first and ship update then (I hope I could fix this...let's say before year
2000...(kse)). Stockpile usage can be toggled using 'order TKY stockpile
[on|off]'.

Update
I hope this clears up a bit what is happening during updates to each TKY's:
  * Process move orders (only T and K)
  * Hop if sector is ready and autoscrap if hop fails
  * Do you thinks to sector
  * Autoscrap Y's

Other changes

Terraformers will terraform sector owned by other players but civilians and
military are not destroyed, owner is not changes and victims receives warning
message.

Fuel bug

Order jump tells different amount of fuel jump
needs than it actually does.

Two reasons here. One is no bug...Planets move
before jump happens so distance is slightly
different. Another one: calculations don't take
account of mass of hanger ships fuel. (Maybe nor
resos or dest either?)
---

New better insurgency formulas.
---

New better adventurism.
---

Recykling shipnumbers.

(Tasta kylla joutuu viela tilille...) Joo, se olisi
varmaankin yksi 5.1:een tulevista parannuksista.
Tarkemmin planeetta- ja alustietokantojen rakenteen

---

Beam up technology to station class ships (S H O X)

You can load stuff inside station class ship (if it
is in low orbit) by beam up (sector) (commodity)
(amount) command. No need to land on planet.
---

Stockpile use for Y and K

Y and K works before planet produces. This makes
problems if Y and K are using stockpile. Changing
this order could be a good idea.
