  about -- Welcome to GB

Galactic Bloodshed, copyright (c) 1989-1990 Robert P. Chansky,
smq@ucscb.uscs.edu, Univerisy of California at Santa Cruz.

Version: GB+ 6.0

"GB" stands for "Galactic Bloodshed". It is a multiplayer galactic exporation,
colonization and conquest game. GB is a game played on a network by several
users at various sites. The home site, where the game and its database reside,
is generally referred to as the "server".

__The Game__
At the beginning of the game, a player selects thw type of race and home planet
he would like. There are two major types of races: mesomorphs (metamorphs) and
techies. Techies are normal humanoid races. Mesos can absorb people, and have
group consciousness. Home worlds range from asteroids to gas giants though the
players on tiny planets tend not to do well.
In the early phases of the game, it is important to build large populations on
as many planets as possible. This involves investing in technology, exploration,
and developing planets.
The game from there goes in the next stage where players begin meeting each
other and either fighting or forming alliances. As the game progresses, some
races die off and a few players or alliances usually start dominating the game.
Ships, also get more and more powerful.

__Basic Rules__
GB operates on an update (or turn) basis. Each update is also broken into
segments. When a player performs an action, it may occur immediately or wait
until the next segment or update. An example of an immediate action is firing a
laser or loading cargo into a ship. On movements, ships actually move. On an
update, ships move, jump through hyperspace, populations increase or decrease,
pollution increases, technology level goes up, taxes are earned, and maintenance
is paid among other things.
Each solar system and the galactic level earn APs on every update for a player
based on population and number of ships. Almost any action uses APs. When you
run out of APs in a system, you are unable to do anything in that system.

__How to Start Playing__
The first step is to start reading alt.games.gb. The FAQ will fill in a lot of
gaps in this article. The client and server code is available on:
  ftp://scam.berkeley.edu/pub/gb
Then you have to find a game. The best thing to do is to wait for a new game
starting up. They are usually posted on alt.games.gb. Sometimes there are
newbie games. Please, however, do not play unless you are sure that you can
regularly spend the time playing. If you dutn out to be wrong, give your race
over to another player. Races dropping out in the middle of the game can
unbalance a game pretty badly.

__Conclusion__
GB is fun, but dangerously addictive. Also, it demands serious time commitments
from its players. If you decide to play, just remember it is only a game.

  *   Finally, remember that the deity of the game is there to help   *
  * you. If it weren't for him/her, you wouldn't be playing GB at     *
  * all. So don't whine. Be polite. Make constructive comments. It'll *
  * be easier for everyone that way.                                  *

& actionpoints

{{CONCEPT}}
  actionpoints -- Indicators to time and possibilites to run a race during one
                  update.

Action Points are built up slowly by the player's presence in a solar system.
They are a mechanism to represent the "bureaucratic grind" of a star-spanning
government. Every command uses a certain number of action points; some commands,
being observatory in nature, use none.
A player's action points for each system are displayed in his prompt when his
scope is in that system (changed by the 'cs' command). The action point cost of
each command can be found just before it's listing in each document entry.
Each solar system and the galactic level earn APs on every update for a player
based on population and number of ships. When you run out of APs in a system,
you are unable to do anything in that system. APs can be reallocated from the
galactic (global) level to a particular system, but that is usually reserved
for important situations as global APs are a rare and precious commodity.

& afv

{{CONCEPT}}
  AFV -- Armored Fighting Vehicles

{{DESCRIPTION}}
AFVs, denoted by the letter R, represent giant mechanical "robots" controlled
in most cases by a single crewmember.
AFVs are ground based ships with guns, armor, and legs to move around the
planet. They are moved on the surface via 'walk' command. They can only move one
sector at time, and each sector they walk uses up 1 fuel point.
AFVs are designed to be used in assaulting enemy troops, (civs/mil), other
ships, and other AFVs. If an AFV walks into a sector with no enemy ships, but
enemy troops, then the AFV will use his weapons and his legs to shoot and kick
the enemy troops. This uses destruct. The AFV will continue until all enemy
troops in this sector are dead, or the AFV itself is destroyed. The AFV will
take damage from the troops it is attacking, depending on the number and type
(civ/mil/both) of enemy troops in the sector being walked into. If the sector
being walked into contains an enemy AFV, then both AFvs will assault each othe
until one (or both) is destroyed. If there are enemy troops as well as an AFV,
the AFV will be attacked first, and if the attacking AFV survives then it will
hit the troops.
If a player orders troops into a sector containing an enemy AFV, they will
attack the AFV, and either destroy it orbe forced to retreat.
The fighting strength of an AFV is = tech * guns * armor * fight modified by
appropriate modifiers.
Note that AFV do NOT need crewmembers equal to the number of guns it has to fire
all of them, only one crewmember will be required.

& automove

{{CONCEPT}}
  automove -- TKY ship automatic moving

Auto-Movement (hopping)
TKY's are moving themselves once they consider their job done in sector they are
landed. They will move to the most suitable sector to continue their job.
Command 'order <ships> limit n' could be used to control their decision to move
and command 'order <ships> hop [on|off]' could be used to turn auto-movement on
or off.
Terraformers will terraform the sector they are landed on in one segment so
'limit n' setting is used to control the selection of the next sector to
terraform: value n (in percents) will limit their activity to sectors that has
capability less than n% for your race. So if you have compatibilities 100% of
land and 70% for water you should give 'order T limit 70' to prevent water
sectors from being terraformed. T's will 1st look if there is suitable target
sector that you own if not unowned sectors are searched. If T hops to unowned
sector that will be randomly chosen to prevent other players to predict where
you T is going to be after update. NOTE: you can still T's move orders - move
orders will be evaluated first and then auto-hop so using move and hop at same
time could lead to quite confusing results.
Space plows will do auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has higher
fertility than their limit setting. As with T's player's own sectors are
preferred and old move code is still working. K's will hop to sector that has
lowest fertility (even if it is higher than its limit setting - so you could
give 'order K limit 1', K's will hop in every update but you planet will end up
100% fert in each sector) if all player's own sectors has 100% fert K's will hop
to any sector that has minimum fertility value target sector will be chosen by
random.
Domes will auto-hop if the sector they are landed on has higher efficiency than
their limit setting is. They will hop only to player's own sectors. Sector of
lowest eff is chosen and if there is more than one sector eff target will be
chosen by random.

& beginner

{{CONCEPT}}
  beginner -- Advice for beginners

{{DESCRIPTION}}
If you are a beginner to Galactic Bloodshed (GB), no problem. They game may seem
a bit overwhelming at first, but so is everything at first :) Just relax, get a
cup of coffee, and enjoy. A typical GB game may last months and everything you
do first, even if you are out of touch for awhile, isn't totally critical! You
can take off for the weekend, and have a real life at the same time and come
back and have your race intact.
At any rate, what *is* GB anyway? Well, it's a wargame. But it is also a
campaign style war game. It is also a game of diplomacy, making and breaking
alliances, back stabbing, and megalomania! All accessible via the net!
Basically, you start off with a race of people, and every race has it's own
unique set of characteristics. What you want to do with this race is explore and
maybe conquer the galaxy and be great big and famous and powerful...! BUT, you
can't do it alone, this is an important point ;)
Speaking of points, what is the *point* of GB in the first place? Well, you want
to *have fun*! Yes, that's the whole poing of any game isn't it? If you don't
want to have fun, stop reading here and may your first born have the nose of
camel and drink like one too :) In order to have fun you must realize at first -
not all races are the same! In fact, every race is different. Every race has
advantages and disadvantages. During the first set of updates, things may seem
uneven - but it's how you play the game in the long run which matters! Trust me
on this.
Each turn in GB is called an 'update'. Updates are run at a schedule set by your
game administrator (player #1 always!). During each update, your population
explores new sectors, the planets revolve about their primaries (using Keppler's
laws), ships are moved, production of resources, fuel, etc. are made. In between
updates you can order your ships, move your people about on planets, attack
enemy ships and planets, design your shipts, etc...
What you want to do at first, is gather 50 resources, and then build a
factory. A factory is essential to the game. These things build ships! You build
a factory, then tell it what kind of ship design you want to make. The available
ship designs are based on your technology which grows each update. It takes a
factory time to be ready to build it's ship design. Once the factory is ready,
you can build ships there!
Next thing you want to do is explore the galaxy. Other planets in your home
start system should always be examined first. You might want to start colonies
on these. If you find a planet which you think your race can live on, land there
and colonize!
As the game goes on, you will definitely run into other races. Talk to them!
They may be good allies in the end - or maybe horrid enemies. That's up to
you. there's a big universe out there! And remember to *have fun*!

:)

& blocks

{{CONCEPT}}
  blocks -- Power blocks

Each race may lead one alliance block. Alliance blocks do not force alliances
among it's members. In fact, it solely is used for politiical purposes. However,
an alliance block can win the game by accumulating the required number of
victory points.

& civilians

{{CONCEPT}}
  civilians -- Representatives of your race

Civilians and military are two different type representatives of your
race. Civilians have a fighting strength equal to your race's fight. Military
has fighting strength 10 times stronger than your civilians.
Contrary to what you might think, military cannot pilot ships or fire
guns...only civilians can do that. Thus, if you have 5 guns on your explorer and
2 mil and 3 crew, you will only be able to fire 3 guns at a time. Also, if you
have only mil on board a given ship (i.e. your only civ on board gets killed by
a lucky shot from an enemy), you cannot order this ship to any destination. Only
fighters, afvs, and robotic ships may fire more guns than they have cre
(obviously).
Only civilians can multiple, so if you inhabit sector with military only it's
population will not grow. It will not descrease because military can survive on
non compatible sectors. Sector efficiency and fertility will stay as it is also.
You can tun military back to civilians by disarming them. No money or
destruction can be recovered.

& client

{{CONCEPT}}
  client -- Client utility

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Because the Galactic Bloodshed game sequence is running on a unix server, the
player needs software to connect to the daemon process. Traditionally this was
done using telnet, however, over the years GB has become quite a sophisticated
piece of software that pretty much requires its own connection software, this is
the client.
There are many GB clients out there, these are some of the more common that
you'll find out there:
  gbII By Evan Koffler
    This is the second generation of unix client for GB, it you're a real man
    you'll probably use this. The original can be found via ftp at
    scam.xcf.berkely.edu. I also have a hacked gbII which has a few extra handy
    features at ftp.towerravens.com. If you're currently using gbII you can type
    'helpc' for help with it.
  Jumunian JavaClient by Kari Seppanen
    This is by one of the folks involved in the GB HUT project. This is not a
    java applet and it does not require the JRE. There is a homepage for it at:
    http://www.hut.fi/~kse/gb/JavaClient/
  VBRG by Tim Brown
    This is a GB client for Windows 95 written in Visual Basic. It is a 10 MB
    beast. More info at: http://www.incenter.org/gb/vbgb.html
  JavaGB by Tim Brown
    Another java client on par with gbII. You'll find more information at:
    http://www.incenter.org/gb/javagb.html
I'm sure you'll also find a few other older gb clients out there as well, like
xgb, and gbpc, however, I have no further info on these.

& colony

{{CONCEPT}}
  colony -- One inhabited planet

To start a colony, you must first build a ship. Several ships are excellent for
colony development, but this really depends on your racial characteristics. For
example, an explorer can only carry few crew members. Shuttles do well for this
purpose since they are cheap.
At the beginning of the game it is important to get your race established on the
several planets in your solar system and get a good resource base, then expand
to other solar systems.
Once your ship is in orbit around the planet you must land it on a sector
there. Your race has a few sector types that they like; these are listed in your
racial profile. You should survey a few sectors to see which can actually hold
your colony. Also look for a sector with lots of resources. Every update sector
efficiency increases if it is inhabited by race who got compatibility for that
sector type, so it's a good idea to occupy as much compatible sectors you can,
even if your population will not yet survive that sector.
Population of a sector increases (or decreases) toward the sector's max
population value, so take this inot account. A sector that is a wasteland will
kill 90% of its population every update.
Land your ship there, and use load to unload some people. Congratulations, you
have a new colony.
Most of the time your colony planets will be less than ideal places to
live. There are some devices to help you terraform your new planet. One of these
is the atomsphere processor, which sucks in the atmosphere and converts it to
one more suitable to you. If your planet is too hot to begin with, a canister of
dust luanched into orbit will absorb sunlight and make it cooler. This has an
added effect of being bale to make a planet inhospitable to another race.
Efficiency on a sector represents how "built up" the area is. This number
increases as time goes by, according to how many people are there to do the
work. Efficiency, in turn, controls how many people the sector can support. The
maximum population is the sum of the maximum sector populations of every
sector. As the planet's popluation increases toward this figure, environmental
conditions, prepresented by toxicity, worsen. Toxicity also affects the maximum
population of the sectors on the planet, sometimes causing an increased death
rate and massive damage to the planet beyond a certain threshold (85).
To deal with this you have to build toxic waste cnaisters. Each one can hold up
to 20 units of waste, but can be built with less. The canisters, if breached,
add their waste back to the planet. Even orbiting them will not alleviate this
problem; you must send them to another planet (preferably someone else's).

& combat

{{CONCEPT}}
  combat -- Battle on a surface of a planet

{{DESCRIPTION}}
'move' and 'deploy' commands are used to move civilan/troops from one sector to
an adjacent sector. If a destination sector is occupied by aliens, the combat
strengths of the player (attacker) and alien (defender) are computed. The combat
strengths depend on number of beings, fighting ability, sector terrain and
technology of the races according to the formula:
  strength = [(civ) * (fighting ability) + (troops) * (fighting ability) * 10]
             * (sector compatibility factor) * (terrain defense factor)
             * morale_factor(difference of race morales)
The assault is evaluated and casulties are remove from each sector. The origggin
sector is where the people will begin to move from. This must be occupied
by the player. Attacking commands are:
  deploy <origin sector x,y> <direction>  <numbers of troops>
  move <origin sector x,y> <direction> <number of civilians>
If number of civ/troops argument is not given, all in the original sector will
be moved. If a negative number is specified, the all civs or troops, except for
the amount specified, will move.
If mesomorphic races are involved in the combat, and are victorious, by either
taking the assaulted sector or repulsing an attack, they may absorb alien
bodies, adding to their own numbers. Note that all enemy casualties are
converted to civilans (not troops!).
  Defense strengths of terrain:
    wasted = 0
    land   = 1
    sea    = 1
    gas    = 2
    ice    = 2
    desert = 2
    mount  = 3
    forest = 3
    plate  = 4
Attacking is not possible on planets that have been enslaved to another
race. Moving civilians uses up more action points than moving troops.

& commodities

{{CONCEPT}}
  commodities -- Goodies

RESOURCE
Resource is the basic commodity, which is needed to build and fix ships and
repair wasted sectors.
Each sector have resource deposity. You can mine these by inhabiting
sector. Amount of produced resources depends mostly on sector efficiency,
secondly races metabolism and of course when deposity is getting empty
production will decelerate. Resource production is most important thing among
expanding your empire to succeed in game. Often, races with low metabolism
and/or small homeworlds or worse, a combination of the two, will take painfully
long to start generating any.
There is two ships that can turn fuel to resources. Chemistry plant y (y is not
very often in games) and space habitat H. H uses 20 fuel to make one resource
(this rate depends on game settings however).

FUEL
Fuel is the energy source of all ships. Also lasers use fuel to attack with. 2
points of fuel is equivalent to 1 light gun.
Sectors produce fuel just like and as much as resources. One exception is jovian
sectors which produce double amount of fuel. Ships orbiting jovian planet can
also suck fuel from jovian atmosphere. Tanker ships are especially effective on
this, they can scoop 1/5 of tanker room fuel each update.

DESTRUCTION
Desctructive potential is what guns shoot. Arming troops requires destruction
also.
There is two ways to create destruction. Weapons plant W is a ship that produces
it (1 fuel + 1 resource = 1 destruction). One W can only make tech / 2 amount of
destruction every update. Another way to produce destruction is to rise sector
mobilization. On such a sector part of resource production pops up directly as
destruction.

& communications

{{CONCEPT}}
  communications -- How to communicate with other players

{{NAME}}
  [0] announce -- Make an announcement
  [0] broadcast -- Make a global announcement
  [0] think -- Make an announcement to your governors and race leader
  [1] post -- Post a news message to all players

{{SYNTAX}}
  announce <message>
  broadcast <message>
  think <message>
  post

{{DESCRIPTION}}
If a player not at universal scope, he/she can make an announcement. The player
must have deity status or physically be inhabiting the system in some
capacity. All players who are current at that systems scope who also inhabit the
system may receive the messages. This allows players to have conferences through
the game interface.
A player can send a message to all players currently logged in with the
'broadcast' command. Players can ignore broadcasts by using 'toggle gag'.
If a player uses think command, only currently logged in own race governors and
race leader receives the message.
Messages can also be posted to the news using the 'post' command. This
(depending on game settings) costs action points.

& crystal

{{CONCEPT}}
  crystal -- Extremely valuable dillithium energy source

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  When the universe is created, some sectors on planets may contain crystal
deposits denoted by an 'x'. As long as there are crystals in a sector the symbol
remains on the sector. Through their explorations players will find sectors that
have these deposits although they can never know exactly how many crystals are
hidden in the sector.
  When a player occupies a sector with crystal deposits in them, during the
update, his race will attempt to find crystals. The probability of success per
update is equal to the sector efficiency. During an update, the planet's total
crystal production can be determined by setting autoreport. A line telling how
many crystals are in the player's stockpiles also will appear on map.
Crystals are like other commodities, populations, resources, fuel, and
destruct. They may be loaded and unloaded from ships as for other
commodities. They may also be captured just like other commodities.
  If a ship with hyper-drive has at least one crystal on board, the player may
mount the crystal into the hyper-drive (see help on the 'mount' command). Only
one crystal needs to be mounted. However a player may carry more if he/she
chooses. If a player has a crystal mounted in the hyper-drive, the ship does not
need to recharge, it is always considered to be charged for hyper-space jump
during the update. The crystal also allows the ship to travel longer distances
due to fuel efficiency.
  Crystals in the hyper-drive also allows a player to use laser-beam-like
weapons. These weapons, however, will consume fuel, not destruct to
operate. These weapons have the same effect as normal fire, except there is no
limit to how much fuel you may expend in an attack.
  Players should be careful of the amount of fuel they wish to put through a
crystal at anytime. Crystals may break, rendering them useless, or, in extreme
cases, cause the detonation of the ship they are in, along with everything else
nearby.
  The maximum safe limit of fuel passing through a crystal deponds on ships
tech. For every point of fuel passed through above (shiptect / 2) increases
chance breaking it and every point of fuel passed through above (shiptech)
increases chance of blowing up the ship!

& daemon

{{CONCEPT}}
  daemon -- Unix server daemon

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  The Galactic Bloodshed game sequence is controled by a __daemon__. The daemon
is a program which constantly runs on a unix server. This __daemon__ updates the
positions of the ships, planets and stars at a set time interval (usuallye 1 to
3 hours, det by the game master). The growth/depletion of the planetary
resources, population, fuel and destructive capacity is monitored and updated by
this program. To play GB the player's client connects to the GB __daemon__ where
between updates, players may issue commands, construct ships, initiate attacks
and do whatever they see fit with the available commands.
  Because the __daemon__ is running at all times it isn't necessary for players
to present at all times; interstellar travel takes some time, and it takes
several iterations of the __daemon__ to generate significant changes
planetary status. It is wise, however, to check up on things from time to time
to keep yourself from getting overrun by some hostile race...

__Game master information__
  The Galactic Bloodshed game sequence is controller by two defines in
__tweakables.h__.
  The first is {{DEFAULT_UPDATE_TIME}}. This specifies an interval of minutes
between updates.
  The second is {{MOVES_PER_UPDATE}}. This specifies how many movement segments
should be included in each update phase. An update counts as one movement
segment; so, if you set this to 1, there will be zero segments between
update. Setting it to 3 would give you two evenly spaced movement segments
between the updates. Any movement segments between updates will be evenly spaced
in terms of time.
  To provide a little randomness into the expected update/movement time, there
are two more defines: {{DEFAULT_RANDOM_UPDATE_RANGE}} and
{{DEFAULT_RANDOM_SEGMENT_RANGE}}. A random number of minutes between zero and
these values will be added to the "programmed" update/movement time. (I'm not
exactly sure why this is needed, but the old GB_daemon program used to do this,
so I left it in).
  The server now keeps track of when the last update/movement_time was using two
new files: {{DFILE(Update.time)}} and {{DFILE(Segment.time)}}. The last
modification time of these files indicates the last time of that particular
operation. In addition, the ascii value in Segment.time specified which movement
segment was the last one performed. If this value is less than
{{MOVES_PER_UPDATE}}, there are more movement segments to do. When the server
starts up, it looks at these files to determine the next update/movement
times. If it determines that the time indicated was in the past (it was down
when it would normally have done an update/movement), it will basically "skip"
that time and figure the next time from when it was started (i.e., the next
update time will be {{DEFAULT_UPDATE_TIME}} minutes into the future).
  One other file added was {{PATH(nogo)}}. If this file exists, the server will
not do any "automatic" updates/movements. When the file is removed or does not
exist, updates/movements will continue normally. I have found it useful to make
crontab entries to create/delete this file on weekend, effectively stopping
updates/movements during that time.
  You may still connect to the server and give either the update or movement
password to cause one of these things to happen. This overrides the existence
check for the nogo file (just like the old GB_daemon).

{{CAVEATS}}
- This server modification does away with the need for the GB_daemon
program. The function provided by the daemon program has been internalized by
the server.
- {{DEFAULT_UPDATE_TIME}} used to specify hours, not minutes.

& fleets

{{CONCEPT}}
  fleets -- Detachements of ships under a singular command

{{IMPORTANT}}
  This is an old idea taken from the HAP version of GB, somehow, it didn't make
it into this source tree (GB+). However, being an ex-HAP player, I've found that
fleets were quite handy so I have added it with the simplest of changes to the
source code (not quite the beast as in HAP, however, with the full
functionality). Because this is new code watch for bugs and please report
them. Thanks, -Mike

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  Ships may be placed in a fleet for ease of issuing orders. They are not required
to be of the same ship type, nor do they initially have to be in the same scope
or location.
  A ship may be ordered to a fleet with the __order__ command, example:
    order #213 fleet q
  This will place ship 123 into fleet Q. You may also order all ships of a given
type in the current scope to a fleet, the following example orders all
destroyers at scope to fleet D:
    order d fleet d
  The letters A-Z are used for fleet assignments, thus each Race is permitted to
have up to 26 fleets which must be shared between existing governors. Upon
assigning ships to a new or unused letter the governor issuing the order because
the 'admiral' of the new fleet. All governors may view the existing fleets with
the __fleet__ command. A governor may not add a ship to another admiral's fleet,
however, they may remove (detach) it if they are permitted to issue orders to
that ship.
  To help organize fleets are permitted to name their fleets, however they must
first change scope to any ship in that fleet and issue the "name fleet <new
name>" command.
  Once a fleet has been created it may be ordered as a group with the __order__
command, however, prepend a '%' sign to the fleet letter to distinguish it from
a ship type. For example, the following command sets a new destination for all
ships in fleet N:
    order %n dest /Tuk/Rom
  This it is simple to keep track of and issue orders to groups of ships wihtout
first having to cs to the proper scope or issuing orders to individual ships or
types of ships.
  If you would like to disband a fleet, the following command will work:
    order %f fleet
  This command will unset the fleet assignment of all ships in that fleet.
  You may also apply the fleet character (%) with a fleet letter to the launch,
load, land, and fire commands.

& formulas

{{CONCEPT}}
  formulas -- Computations algorithms of importance

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Some of the moew technical players like to know how certain aspects of the game
are determined. This section describes some of the formulas used in Galactic
Bloodshed.

__Fire Formula__
The formula used to determine the hit probability is:
  probabiltity = 100 / (1 + (range / 50% range))
When the range = '50% range', the chances of hitting the target is 50%. The
'50% range', or 'effective radius' of a ship's guns is determined from the above
factors as:
  50% range = (((log10(1 + technology of ship) * 80 * body^(1/3) * 72) /
              (2 + fev)) / (2 + fev)) / (18 + fspd + tspd)
where
  tech = The technology of the firing vessel or of the race (for planet firing)
  body = Target size
  fev = 0 or 1 for whether or not firing vessel
  tev = Defending ship evasive maneuvers
  fspd = Firing ship speed
  tspd = Target ship speed
Using the above porbability formula a hit or miss determination is made for each
shot. After which, each successful hit is checked for possible target
penetration. Armor is the primary factor for determining the probability of
penetration:
  penetration probability = factor ^ armor
where
            2            firing ship technology + 1
  factor = -- arctan(5 * --------------------------)
           PI            target ship technology + 1
Every 5 hits in a salvo against a target reduces its armor value for that attack
by 1. The structural damage to the ship is then evaluated by the formula:
  % damage = (2 * caliber * penetrated hits) / body
Because damage is represented in percentage, large ships are capable of
sustaining more damage than small ships.
  body = SQRT(size / 10)
Every hit has a chance of being a critical hit, the size of the ship determines
probability; smaller ships are more likely to received critical hits:
  critical hit probability = size / caliber : 1
For example, a Battleship with a size of 30 has a 30:1 odds of taking a critical
hit from each penetration. A fighter group with size 10 and no armor has a 10:1
odds against such a hit. Each critical hit is then evaluated, and if successful,
a random amount of damage between 1% and 100% is give in addition to previous
damage.

__Modify Formula__
The cost of producing the ship is determined, after evaluating the total
'advantage' and total 'disadvantage', by:
  (cost) = ((base cost) * (1 + advantage)) / (1 + disadvantage)
And advantage/disadvantage is computed, for each modifiable attribute, by:
  ((new value + 1) / (standard value + 1)) - 1
For each attribute, if this number is positive it is considered to be an
'advantage' and if it is negative, the absolute value of it is considered to be
a 'disadvantage'. All ships built at a factory may have hyper-space jump
capabilities by installing 'hyperdrive'. Having this is assumed to be an
advantage of 1. Each point of armor above the standard amount is considered an
advantage. Each point below the standard is a disadvantage. The maximum value by
which an attribute may be modified to is dependent on the technology the factory
used to construct the ship by:
  (max value) = MAX(1, tech / 100) * (standard value)

__Insurgency Formula__
The probability of a successful insurgency is given by the following formula:
  chance = (tax factor) * (inhabiting factor) * (money factor) *
           (minimum money factor)
where
                                             victim
  tax factor = (TAX_RATE * 0.8) + (0.2 * ---------------)
                                         (victim + 1000)
  victim = Your victim's population in system
So tax factor will be 0.2 if TAX_RATE is 0% and colony is big. There is a safety
factor that keeps tax factor near 0.0 if colony is very small.
                                popula
  inhabiting factor = sqrt(-----------------)
                           (popula + victim)
If you have a lot of population in system compared your vicitim's population
chance of successful insurgency will be much higher.
                   (2 * money)
  money factor = ----------------
                 (money + colony)
where
  money = Amount of money you spend
  colony = Victim population on colony in question
and
                              money
  minimum money factor = --------------
                         (money + 4000)
where
  money = Amount of money you spend
This one prevents attempts to cause revolts too cheaply. Factor disappears
(closer to 1) when the amount of money is big. After a successful insurgency,
the chance that each sector will revolt is:
  (revolt chance) = (compatibility factor) * (morale factor) * 0.5 *
                    (military factor)
where
  compatibility factor = Your compatibility % to sector types in question
  morale factor = Depends on you and your victim's morale
  military factor = Success is harder if there are troops in sector

& hyperdrive

{{CONCEPT}}
  hyperdrive -- A piece of equipment that allows jumps through hyper-space

{{DESCRIPTION}}
The hyperdrive is a piece of equipment that allows ships to jump through
hyperspace, and travel much much faster than with normal pulsedrives. The
destination can be any starsystem in the galaxy and once the hyperdrive is
charged, the jump will happen in one update no matter the distance. Charging
the hyperdrive will take two more updates. Hyperdrives use a lot more fuel than
normal pulsedrives. The amount of spent fuel follows the formula:
  fuel = 5 * mass^0.5 * (distance / (200 * (technology + 1)))^3
So it's obvious that a ship's fuel capacity limits the possible jumping distance.
If a ship with a hyperdrive has at least one crystal on board, the player may
mount the crystal into the hyperdrive (see help on the 'mount' command). Only
one crystal needs to be mounted. If a player has a crystal mounted in the
hyperdrive, the ship does not need to recharge, it is always considered to be
charged for hyper-space jump duing the update. The crystal also allows the ship
to travel longer distances due to fuel efficienty. Formula with crystal is:
  fuel = 5 * mass^0.5 * (dist / (200 + (tech + 100)))^2
Crystals in the hyperdrive also allow a player to use laser-beam-like weapons.

HOW TO USE HYPERDRIVE
  1) Your ship needs to have a hyperdrive. (Some ships can't have it at all).
     Factories built after reaching hyperdrive tech will produce ships with it.
     You can also upgrad hyperdrive ships with 0% damage.
  2) If you have available crystal, load it into your ship and mount it.
  3) Launch your ship (if landed) and order the destination
  4) Order jump on.

Now the ship's hyperdrive will begin to charge. And after the third update (with
crystal after next update) you'll find your ship in the destination starsystem.
If the ship didn't have enough fuel to do jump, instead of jumping the
hyperdrive will turn off.

& infrastructure

{{CONCEPT}}
  infrastructure -- The infrastructure machine.

{{DESCRIPTION}}
This machine is built on a planet (build ? i) and is used to increase efficiency
and fertilization of planet sectors. You can set up to 20 target sectors for
each. The targets can be different sectors or they can be duplicated to increase
them faster.

Example commands:
  order i inf eff 10             Sets 10 sectors to increase, it will choose the
                                 lowest ones.
  order i inf eff target 0,0 75  Uses one target setting to focus on 0,0. It
                                 stop after getting eff to 75%. It will use one
                                 setting for this.
  order i inf atmos 1            Have the machine improve the atmosphere more to
                                 your race's liking.
  order i inf report on          This will tell the machine that you want
                                 reports every update on what it did.

& lasers

{{CONCEPT}}
  lasers -- Ships may mount combat lasers for use in battle

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Some ships may be permitted to mount combat lasers at time of construction. Race
required a laser tech to do that. A ship which has a laser mounted may
optionally use these for firing instead of the normal guns. Unlike guns, lasers
use fuel equivalent to one light gun. the player must also have a crystal
mounted to use the fuel for attacking.
There is no limit to the amount of fuel that may be used in an attack. However,
there is a tehnological stability limit, beyond which crystal damage may result,
or even an explosion. Ship explosion is determined by the formula:
  Explosion if rand(0, strength) > ship tech / 2
A 100 technology ship may fire up to 50 strength points safely, a 200 tech ship
100, etc. Pushing it far beyond this limit may result in a matter/anti-matter
explosion!
Crystals may damage before they explode a ship. The chances of damage (and hence
an automatic dismount and loss of the crystal) is determined by:
  Damaged if rand(0, strength) > ship tech / 4
A ship will only fire lasers if told to do so. This is done using the order
command 'order <ship> laser on <default strength>'. The laser may be turned off
with 'order laser off'. If the laser is set on, then executing the 'fire'
command uses lasers instead of normal weapons.
Lasers may be set to 'focus' or 'non-focus' mode by using
'order <ship> focus <on/off>'. In focused mode, the entire salvo will either hit
or miss (based on the hit probability), while in non-focused mode each strength
point of the salvo is evaluated for hit or miss.
Technology limits on functional crystal ranges are proportional to the amonut of
damage on the ship. Heavily damaged ships may find their crystals breaking at
lower limits.
Command 'ship' line 'safe' will tell you maximum salvo ship can fire without
chance of breaking the crystal.

& maintain

{{CONCEPT}}
  maintain -- Money is needed to pay troops and ships.

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Money is needed to pay the costs of troops and ships each update. Maintenance
costs are deducted from the player's treasury, and if funds are not available in
the treasury, the deficit is deducted from the race's morale.
Each ship must be paid an amount equal to it's build cost if there are
non-military crew on board the ship (robot ships, some civilian ships and
'mothballed' ships do not pay this cost). Each troop, whether on a ship or
planet costs an additiona $1 to maintain.

  money, morale, treasury, military

& military

{{CONCEPT}}
  military -- Army troops

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Civilians and military (troops) are two different type representatives of your
race. Civilians have a fighting strength equal to your race's fight. Military
have fighting strength 10 times stronger than your civilians. Contrary to what
you might think, military cannot pilot ships or fire guns...only civilians can
do that. Thus, if you have 5 guns on your explorer and 2 mil and 3 crew, you
will only be able to fire 3 guns at a time. Also, if you have only mil onboard a
given ship (i.e. your only civ on board gets killed by a lucky shot from an
enemy), you cannot order the ship to any destinations.
Only civilians can multiply, so if you inhabit a sector with military only, its
population will not grow. It will not decrease either because military can
survive on non-compatible sectors. Sector efficienty and fertility will stay as
they are as well.
You can make military by arming civilians. That will cost $5 each and some
amount of destruction. Amount depends on sector mobilization level, higher the
mobility cheaper the arming. Unlike civilians, military moves when you order
them to deploy.

& missiles

{{CONCEPT}}
  missiles - Interplanetary ballistic missiles

{{DESCRIPTION}}
 Missiles are a special ship type. They must be constructed in a factory. The
 strength of a missile in an attack is dependent on its destruct
 payload. Missiles attack during the segments. When a missile arrives at its
 destination it is detonated and damage to the target is evaluated. The missile
 is destroyed. To attack with a missile, the destination must be ordered. The
 destination is either a ship or a planet. If the destination is a planet, the
 player can order the sector for the missile to land on by using
 'order <missile> impact <x,y>'.

{{SEE ALSO}
  order

& money

{{CONCEPT}}
  money - Galactic Credits

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Money can be used by players as a medium of exchange and can be trasferred using
the 'pay' command. Money is generated by setting tax rates at key planets using
the 'tax' option.
Money generated from taxes, in addition to being exchangable using the 'pay'
option, can be used to increase racial technology levels using the 'technology'
option. You can buy goodies from GB Commodities Market (see bid to get more info
about this). Revolutions on planets can also be instigated with
'insurgency'. Money is also used to pay maintenance costs of armies and ships.

& morale

{{CONCEPT}}
  morale - The willingness of your race to be successful in battle

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Morale represents the willingness of your race to be successful in battle. The
morale of race depends on its success in colonization as well as combat
situations. As the morale of a race increases, it becomes more effective against
other races in combat.
Each race starts off with a morale of 0. Each update, each race loses 10% of
it's morale, which is a good thing if it's negative, and receives 1 morale point
for each sector. Morale points are cumulative. Players also receive morale
points for capturing alien occupied sectors and destroying or capturing alien
ships:
  +defenders fight    Capture an alien occupied sector
  -your race's fight  Lose a sector in land combat
  +cost               Capture/destroy an alien ship
  -cost               Lost ship to an alien
  +1/update           For each sector
  -10%/update
During assault/capture and land combat morale between opposing forces is
compared and the 'morale factor' is compute which modifies attack/defence
strengths. Morale factor is given by:
                   1             1
  morale factor = -- arctan(x) + -
                  PI             2
where
  x = (morale difference) / 10000

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Galactic Bloodshed: Fun and Death on the Internet

The first thing to say about Galactic Bloodshed (GB) is that it is not that
bloody (more on this later). GB is a TCP/IP based, multiuser galactic
colonization and conquest game. If you have played Empire, imagine Empire in
space. Normally there are several games being run on the Internet and lots of
people having fun at any given time.

Implementation

GB uses a client-server architecture. There is one major client known as
gbII. On the server side, there have been two major and many minor versions of
the server. The original server, which is still being updated regularly, is
called GB. All code is written in C with the exception of a few supplemental
programs that are not a standard part of the GB distribution. Unfortunately, the
code tends to be rather buggy. Most of the bugs are the minor annoying type of
bugs instead of the total disaster type though they exist also. Additionally,
some versions of the client are incompatible with some versions of the
server. The server is well known for memory leask, and it is in God's (the
person running the game) best interest to restart the server every few
days. Many games have ended due to database corruption instead of having an
actual victor. (ed. note: Code is much more stable nowadays).

For running the server, it is very important to keep the game database smaller
than the size of free RAM on the server machine. If the database is too big, the
server will thrash at times. This not only slows the game down, but the whole
server machine.

Basic Rules

GB operates on an update (or turn) basis. Each update is broken into
movements. When a player performs an action, it may occur immediately or wait
until the next movement or update. An example of an immediate action is firing a
laser of loading cargo into a ship. On movements, ships actually move. On an
update, ships move, jump through hyperspace, populations increase or decrease,
pollution increases, technology level goes up, taxes are earned, and maintenance
is paid among other things.

Action Points (APs) play an important part in the game. Each solar system and
the galactic level earn APs on every update for a player based on population and
number of ships. Almost any action uses APs. When you run out of APs in a
system, you are unable to do anything in that system. APs can be reallocated
from the galactic (global) level to a particular system, but that is usually
reserved for important situations as global APs are a rare and precious
commodity.

At the beginning of the game, a player select the type of race and home planet
he would like. There are two major types of races: mesomorphs (metamorphs) and
techies. Techies are normal humanoid races. Mesos can absorb people, have a
lower intelligence (at least to start with), have group consciousness, and have
space pods. A space pod flies to a remote solar system and explodes sending
spores which land on planets and absorb population. In the earlier days of GB,
mesos had an enormous advantage and almost always won games. Then point based
race creation came along which equalized things. Home worlds range from
asteroids to gas giants though the players on tiny planets tend to not do well.

In the early phases of the game, it is important to build large populations on
as many planets as possible. This involves investing in technology, exploration,
and developing planets. A common mistake by many techie races at this stage of
the game is to wait until they have hyperdrive to explore other
systems. Properly build sublight ships will arrive in other systems long before
the player has hyperdrive. I have noticed two trends regarding starting
location. The first is that the races that do not have nearby neighbors do
extremely well unless they are poorly played. The other is that races that start
on the edge of the galaxy either do extremely well or get stomped quickly. The
reason is that the race either gets surrounded early on and dies off, or
survives and then in the later stages of the game has less fronts to fight
on. For example, in the fall 92 UNM game, all of the major races started on the
edge of the galaxy.

The game from there goes into the next stage where players begin meeting each
other and either fighting or forming alliances. As the game progresses, some
races die off and a few players or alliances usually start dominating the
game. Ships, also, get more and more powerful.

Another method of playing is known as the blitz. In a blitz game, updates happen
every few minutes and the game lasts one night or weekend. I'm going to ignore
blitzes for this article and concentrate on regular games, but most of the
material here applies to blitzes as well as regular games.

Winner & Losers

Several factors distinguish the winner from the losers. Luck of the draw
(starting location and the random number generator) does play a big part in the
game. However, even so certain players almost alwasy do well and others always
do poorly.

Good players always try to be on immediately following an update. On an update,
ships jump through hyperspace, pods explode, and populations increase. When
ships jump through hyperspace, they will often immediately be involved in a
space battle. Your ships will automatically defend themselves if you are not
on. However, manually handling your ship's firing works much better than the
primitive automatic algorithm. When pods explode or populations increase, ground
combat may occur. It is advantageous to be the attacked in almost all cases
because you can try to capture enemy ships instead of vice versa.

Good players spend more time playing. Almost always the races that get more
attention do better. Especially the area of planetary development suffers with
limited attention. However, GB can be addicting and dangerous to the rest of
your life. Working full-time and being a top GB player is doable. Working
full-time, having a girlfriend, and being a top GB player would be tough (I
couldn't do it).

Good players learn timesaving measure to offset playing too much to a
degree. Using client macros is a must for such things as building ships and
launching pods. the other reason I used macros was, on occasion, I would plan
battles out before the update and write a macro. After the update, I would
immediately execute the macro which would make attacks faster than the enemy
could respond. The opttech package is a must for calculating investments. There
are some breaking and automated people moving code in existance, but may not be
publically avialable. Automatic playing programs, known as cyborgs, also exist
by have been banned from many GB games.

Good players report bugs to God and gets God's opinion on whether or not they
should be used. Many players try to keep bugs secret, but usually someone else
figures out what is going on and reports it. The player, who was using the bug
to their advantage, usually ends up getting penalized and incurs the wrath of
the other players in the game. Also allies sometimes desert these people.

Good players do not use the default ship configurations in general. To begin
with, some of the defaults are not well balanced and some of the ship types are
useless in my opinion. I went one game without building a single explorer or
destroyer and used interesting low-tech cargo ships and tanker
configurations. (ed. note: modified caros and takers can't compete with warships
anymore). Also, specialized ships are very useful. the high armor shuttle for
landing on those highly defended planets is a good one. A real game example of
this was the time an enemy used up most of his defensive capability on attacking
my highly armored cargo ships. Then my and my ally's weakly armoed, but heavily
armed, fleet of battleships, missiles, space mies, and Orbital Assault Platforms
(OAPs) came in and easily took over the system.

Good players come up with surprises. One strategy, which is no well known, but
was a shocker in its early use was the "no destruct" missile. In this strategy,
you build two types of missiles. The first ones use the usual conifguration. The
second type are cheap missiles that have no explosion capability (the "no
destruct" missiles). In battle, you launch the "no destruct" missiles first. The
enemy usually flees or expends a log ot firepower on these harmless missiles
leaving thme vulnerale to your real attack.

Good players do not give out too much information about their race. If the enemy
knows where you home world is and all your factories are, then you are not in as
good a defensive position.

Good players know how to play GB politics. This is the real meat of the
game. One of the most famous races of all times Erk in the summer 91 Berkeley
game. The ultrapowerful Erk had made enemies out of basically every other race
in the game with one exception. By the end of the game, Erk was no longer the
top ranked player due to overwhelming odds. The counterexample was Bovin
Combustion in the summer UNM game. The Bovines were another runaway leader
(partly due to incredible racial statistics) though not as much as Erk, but the
Bovines found some relatively strong allies including the third ranked player
and held on to the top ranking.

The formation of alliances is an important step. A good alliance consists of
races that all have a useful characteristic that is missing from the other
races. This could be raw materials (resources), fuel, ground fighting ability,
high technology level, manpower, or strategic location.

However, alliances are not always what they appear. An example was the fall 91
UNM where the Slinkies (me), the Phreddies, and the Rats plus a couple of other
minor races were involved in a secret alliance from very early on in the
game. We have planned out in detail how to confuse, divide, and conquer the
universe. The Phreddies attacked many of their allies disabiling them and
leaving them open to attack form the Rats. I publically called the Phreddies
scum and declared neutrality with them (we had been allies up until then). This
allowed me to maintain good relations with the enemies of the Rats and Phreddies
and gather intelligence on their plans. There is an interesting story on how the
secret alliance had discussions during the game without the other races being
bale to tell that, but I am keepin this trick to myself for future games. :-) A
little later on, the Phreddies blew up one of my ships, which happened to be out
of fuel and useless anyway, to firmly plant the idea that we were not getting
along in the minds of other races. However, at the same time, the Phreddies were
secretly building ships for me. The point of this game description was to show
the lengths that people will go to win. This particular alliance was rath
effective though there were some near disasters like when my close public ally,
the Sons of ET, tried to start a war against the Rats. In another game I was in,
a triple agent existed at one point.

Internet Implications

GB does have an impact on the Internet traffic load. Games are on different port
numbers so there is no way to calculate its overall impact on the network. It is
safe to say that a GB session is roughly equivalent to a high-use telnet
session. It's also safe to say that the majority of the traffic is on the NSFNET
backbone and not CIX in the US. Over 90% of the traffic during a GB session
(byte wise) is from the server to the client. It should be noted that players
with faster internet access to the server have a slight advantage over further
away players. This is especially true when transatlantic links are involved.

How to start Playing

hopefully, by now, you somewhat have a general feeling of how the game
works. The first step is to start reading alt.games.gb. The FAQ will ifll in a
lot of the gaps in this article. The client and server code is available for
anonymous FTP on scam.berkely.edu.

Then you have to find a game. The best thing to do is wait for a new game
starting up. They are usually posted on alt.games.gb. Sometimes there are newbie
games. Please, however, do not play nuless you are sure that you can regularly
spend the time playing. If you turn out to be wrong, give your race over to
another player. Races dropping out in the middle of the game can unbalance the
game pretty badly.

Conclusion

GB is fun, but dangerously addictive. Also, it demands serious time commitments
from its players. If you decide to play, just remember it is only a game.

& production

{{NAME}}
  production [0] - Show latest planet production statistics

{{SYNTAX}}
  production

{{DESCRIPTION}} - COMMAND
This command will show the number of resources, fuel, crystal, and destruct that
a planet production during the previous update.

{{DESCRIPTION}} - CONCEPT
The amonut of resources/fuel/destruct depends produced on a planet can be
determined by two methods, preset by the game master.
In LIMITED resource mode the total amount of resources available at a planet is
finite and player obtain resources by minig the resources. Specifically the
chance of sector producing resources during an update is the efficiency. Players
may construct 'quarry' objects which can be used to also mine resources. It
should be noted however that quarry objects may produce toxicity while in
operation.
In UNLIMITED resource mode each planet has an unlimited of available resources,
and the number of resources obtained from each sector depend on the efficiency,
population, as well as number of resource deposits. This is the 'old-method' of
resource production.

& racegen

{{CONCEPT}}
  racegen - Help generating your race with racegen

{{DESCRIPTION}}
Racegen is a program to construct races for Galactic Bloodshed. It runs as a
separate daemon program usually running on the same server. Typically you
connect to it with your client and spend points to create your race. Once done
it is emailed to your game host (God), then is enrolled into the GB game.
The easiest way to learn how to use racegen is to use it. Connect to it. Type,
"help" to see more info on the available commands. The main command you will use
is "modify". Try modifying a few things: "modify fight 6", "modify name Demons",
"modify pass whatnot". You can save races ("save") and work on them later
("load"); you can also print what the screen shows to files. When you are done
with your race, typing "send" will dispatch it to your game host.

__CHARACTERISTICS
  Absorption - Only metamorphs may have this attribute, which allows them to
               absorb enemy troops and civilians in combat if the morph
               wins. Combined with pods, it allows metamorphs to replace alien
               population on planets wen pods burst.

  Adventurism - This describes what percentage of a sector's population may move
                and explore other sectors. High values tend to settle planets on
                their own far more efficiently. If you have a low value, you can
                order movements with the 'move' option. The amount of population
                to move is equal to the number of race's sexes.
                As you can see from the moving percentage equation this
                percentage follows linearly race's adventurism so 10%
                adventurism is two times as effective as 5% adventurism
                [Note: Experienced player usually settle with low adeventurism.]

  Birthrate - This factor determins how rapidly the population in the sector
              will converge to the maximum population supportable on the there.
              High valus mean that the population multiplies faster.

  Collective IQ; IQ limit - The intelligence of a race with collective IQ is
                            related to the race's total population, as follows:
                            IQ = ID_limit * ((2 / PI)atan(population / 50000))^2
                            [Note: Be carefule with this one! If you can't build
                            pods, then having a collective IQ could be
                            disasterous as you won't have the knowhow to build
                            *any* kind of useful ships for a very long time.]

  Fertilize - This attribute represents the percentage chance that a race will
              increase by one percent the fertility of an sector it owns. Any
              race may take advantage of space plows for a similar effect, once
              it gets to tech level 5.

  Fighting Ability - Higher values mean that the race is more likely to kill an
                     alien than a lower value. Races with lower values will
                     usually need to have larger forces to win in direct combat
                     over a high fighting ability. It is important to note that
                     this effects only land combat and ship boarding strengths,
                     and not ship to ship fighting.

  IQ - The raw growth rate of a race's technology is governed by the race's
       intelligence. The technology increase per update is IQ / 100. Additional
       technology gain is available by tehcnology investments on the individual
       planets under the race's control.

  Mass - Each race has a mass. The heavier the individual, the more fuel it will
         take to launch land travel and hyperjump ships full of the race. Race
         with a good fight might like low mass since heavy weight tends to limit
         troops transferring.

  Metabolism - This value ocntrols how industrious the race is. Higher
               metabolism races will produce resources more rapidly than lower
               metabolisms, and also increase the efficiency of sectors faster.

  Pods - Pods are small shpis, available only to metamorphs but at tech level 0,
         buildable instantly on the surface of planets. Each one may carry a
         single crew-thing; this makes them ideal for settling other
         planets. Pods which enter a system after having frozen in deep space
         will warm and eventually burst, possibly leading to spores landing on
         worlds in the new system. If a spore lands on a sector, a ton or more
         of biomass will be created, resulting in a new colony for the podding
         race. Note that spores may never land on alien occupied sectors unless
         the podding race has absorption.

  Racial type - There are two main racial types in GB: normal races (think of
                humans, Klingons, Wookies, Pierson's Pupeteers, etc.) and
                metamorphs (Alien, the Thing, body snatchers, etc.). The primary
                difference between these two race classes is that only
                metamorphs may have pods and absorption as racial
                attributes. Metamorphs are also required to have one sex, which
                is another advantage.

  Sexes - Each race has a number of sexes. This respresent the minimum
          population that a sector must have in order to be able to
          reproduce. Lower values are preferable to high values for colonization
          efforts. It is not recommended to have more than 3 to 6 sexes at the
          outset, unless you are really looking for a challenge.


__SECTOR_TYPES__
  Desert sector - This is main sectortype of desert planets and also very common
                  on airless planets, and few sectors be found on asteroids and
                  class M planets. Dsesert is resource rich but very log in
                  fertility. It's slightly most common normal sectortype in
                  galaxy.
                  Good choices to combine with desert: land, mountain

  Water sector - This is main sectortype on waterballs and there is lot of water
                 on class M planets also. It can be found on forests too. It's
                 medium rich and got better fertility than average sector.
                 Good choices to combine with water: land, ice, forest, mountain

  Land sector - Land sectors can be found almost everywhere...class M,
                asteroids, airless, deserts. Mostly in class M. Land sectors are
                low in fertility and a bit better than average amount of
                resources.
                Good choices to combine with land: anything but gas

  Mountain sector - There is no special mountain planet, but desert worlds have
                    sometimes lot of it. It can also be found on airless
                    planets, waterballs and asteroids. Mountain is the richest
                    sectortype, but with very low in fertility.
                    Good choices to combine with mountain: desert, ice, land,
                    water

  Forest sector - Forest is highest in fertility sectortype, but it's quite
                  resource poor. It can be found mostly on forest planets. Class
                  M planet usually have some sectors too.
                  Good choices to combine with forest: water, ice

  Ice sector - Ice is nice in fertility and average in resource sector. It can
               be found on class M planets and iceballs.
               Good choice to combine with ice: anything but gas. If you choose
               mountain, take at least third sectortype also.

  Gas sector - It's clearly the most ocmmon sectortype because jovian balls are
               so huge, but it can't be found anywhere else. It's extremely poor
               on resources but large number of them compensates this. It got
               nice fertility.
               Good choices to combine with gas: nothing

  Plated sector - When inhabited non-gas sectors efficiency reaches 100% sector
                  becomes plated. It means whole sector is totally built and
                  nothing of original sector is left. Tokyo is good example of
                  an almost plated sector on isle Honshu.

__PLANET TYPES__

  Class M - 6% - These planets are usually about everything. Mostly land and
                 water. This is rarest type, but also largest normal planet.

  Jovian - 9% - These planets are 100% gaseous, and they are usually twice as
                large as the typical class M planet. they tend to be very high
                in fertility too, so you can easily build up a large population
                for taxation. Also, ships in orbit around Jovians add fuel to
                their holds every update (tankers are very efficient at this),
                so even if you're not a jovian-type race, having one of these
                nearby can be a tremendous asset. [Note: Remember to take some
                adventurism if you choose jovian]

  Water - 9% - These are largely water planets, and they are generally resource
               rich. They can be quite large, randing up in size to class M
               quality, but they are usually about 40% smaller. There is
               mountain isles and navel ice fields on waterballs.

  Desert - 8% - These planets are usually 70% desert and 15% mountain and 15%
                land. Resource content is very high, but they are very poor in
                fertility. They produce lot of resources but population will
                grow very slowly and leave you vulnerable to invasion. Their
                size range is bit smaller than class M planets.

  Forest - 9% - These planets are almost entirely covered in forest, but there
                is also some water and ice. Size range is like Water
                planets. Fertility is lot higher than in any other planettype.

  Iceball - 20% - These planets are generally small (1/5 the size of class M or
                  less), and they consist of around 80% ice and 20%
                  mountain. Relative to their size they are resource rich, but
                  the small number of sectors means that resources will come
                  more slowly. This is most common planettype in galaxy. [Note:
                  Newbie... don't choose iceball]

  Airless - 15% - These small planets are mostly land (60%) whith some mountain
                  and desert sectors. The atmosphere is almost always hostile,
                  of course, but these planets are quite resource rich relative
                  to their size (i.e. 1/2 the resources of a typical forest, but
                  1/4 the size). [Note: Newbie...don't choose airless]

  Asteroid - >20% - these are just floating rocks in space, not good for a heck
                    of a lot. They don't count as planets in victory
                    conditions. Small number (but sometimes extremely rich) of
                    sectors and killing heat make it very difficult for most
                    asteroids to contribute to your cause, though having
                    colonies on them have other advantages, such as morale
                    bonus. Sector types are land, desert, and mountain.

& races

{{CONCEPT}}
  races -- Difference characteristic combinations create different races

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  There are a bunch of programmed racial characteristics which offer players a
large variety in Capabilities. Of course, no one race is intended to be ideal
over another, and players should learn how to optimize their particular
choice. There are 9 basic characteristics of each race:
    1) Mesomorph - A player can request to be a mesomorphic' race. They have an
                   advantage of only 1 sex. They can also take over the bodies
                   of their victims. A well run mesomorphic player can be a
                   formidable foe.

    2) Mass - Each race has a mass. The heavier the individual, the more fuel it
              usually takes to launch and land them. Heavy creatures may require
              more fuel to move around than light creatures.

    3) Birthrate - This factor (infection rate for mesos) controls how rapidly
                   the population in the sector will try to adjust to the
                   maximum support of the sector. High values mean that the
                   populations multiply faster.

    4) Fighting Ability - Higher values mean that the race is more likely to
                          kill an alien with that a lower value. Races with
                          lower values will usually need to have larger forces
                          to win in direct combat over a high fighting
                          ability. It is important to note that this affects
                          only land combat and boarding strengths, and not ship
                          to ship fighting.

    5) Intelligence - The raw growth rate of technology is governed by the
                      race's intelligence. The technology increase per update is
                      IQ / 100. Additional technology boosts for a race is
                      controlled by technology investments by the individual
                      planets under the player's control.

                      Collective intelligence is related to the race's total
                      population, a sort of collective intelligence.
                      Specifically, C IQ = 200 * [(2 / PI) * atan(population /
                      50000)]^2. It's usually a good idea to take advantage of
                      the 'technology investment' option to keep pace with more
                      intelligent racial types.

    6) Adventurism - This describes how often a sector's population wants to
                     move and explore and conquer planets on their own more
                     efficiently. If you have a low value, you can order
                     movements with the 'move' option.

    7) Sexes - Each race has a number of sexes. This represents the minimum
               population that a sector must have in order to be able to
               reproduce. Lower values are preferable to high values for
               colonization efforts.

    8) Metabolism - This value controls how industrious the race. Higher
                    metabolism races will produce resources more rapidly than
                    lower metabolisms.

    9) Fertilize - This attribute represents the percentage chance that a race
                   will increase by one percent the fertility of any sector it
                   owns. Any race may take advantage of space plows for a
                   similar effect, once it gets to tech level 5.

& scope

{{CONCEPT}}
  scope -- Operative scope

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  Scope represents the operative scope of certain commands. The operative scope
(display along with the APs in the user's prompt, and changed with cs) is
similar to the tree-like directory level structure found in most computer
systems, with the root directory being a universe scope followed by the various
stars, followed by the planets orbiting these starts. The scope can also
represent a single ship.
  Commands are affected by the scope in a different manner than that which
operating systems treat their directory structure. For example, if the current
scope is that of a star, the command report, if given with no arguments, will
prompt report or each ship orbiting that star. If the scope was the universal
scope, report would prompt each ship everywhere that the player owns. Many
commands will work differently, or not at all in certain scopes. The syntax of a
scope, when prompted for, is thus:
    path = : | #shipnum | /path | ../path | name | path/name
  The shell will interpret a ':' as meaning the object of the current scope
(star, planet, or ship). A '/' at the beginning of the string represents the
root. It could be followed by a star name, or not, to represent the upper,
interstellar, level. A '..' or '.' represents the scope just above the current
scope. '#shipnum' represents that ship. A number by itself will be interpreted
as meaning a star or planet name. Specifying a name means to move down to that
star or planet.

& segment

{{CONCEPT}}
  segment -- Secondary movement update

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  A movement segment (or a move seg) is a procedure during which the server
updates the positions of all ships in the game based on their current
orders. For example, if you have a ship ordered to move toward a particular
star, planet, or ship, this process moves your ship closer based upon the ship's
speed. You'll receive messages from the server when you arrive at your
destination, at which time your ship stops moving.
  Repairs also occur at move segs. This means that everytime there is a move
seg, any of your ships which are currently trying to repair themselves,
regardless of how they incurred damage, will have their damage percent reduced
by some amount.

& shipdesign

{{CONCEPT}}
  shipdesign -- Some tips when designing ships

{{DESCRIPTION}}
A few tips for Galactic Bloodshed newbies.
  1) Most ships are built by factories. Here is a partial list of ones which
     are not:
       Pods
       Ground Telescopes
       Weapons Plants
       Factories
       Domes
       Space Plows
       Terraformers
       Atmosphere Processors
       ABM Battery
       Gamma Ray Laser
       Government Center
       Planet Defense Net
       (There are others; do a "build ? (letter)" to see what can build a given
       type of ship)

  2) Here is the procedure for building ships in the factories:
    a) Build a factory on a planet. For example "build F 3,2" builds a factory
       on sector 3,2 of the planet you are currently at.
    b) Change scope into the factory. This is done by typing "cs #(shipnumber)",
       where "shipnumber" is the number of the factory in question (note: it
       told you this number when you built the factory in the first place).
    c) Type "make (shipletter)", where "shipletter" is the letter of the ship
       you want to build. For instance "make s" sets the factory to produce
       Shuttles. This is probably what your first factory will be for.
    d) Modify the ship's stats, if desired. (More on this is 3), below).
    e) When you are abso-smurfly positive you have the ship design you want,
       type "order #(shipnumber) on", where "shipnumber" is the number of the
       factory. (note: Turning the factory on costs resources! The cost is equal
       to twice the cost of the ship you will be producing. Also note, you can't
       change the stats of the factory's production model once the factory has
       been turned on. Want to build a new ship type? Build a new factory.)
    f) Wait three update. "Why wait?" you ask? Well, a factory starts at 75%
       damage and can't produce ships until it is fully "healed". Damage heals
       at 25% per update. If the game has movesegs (which they pretty much all
       do these days), the 25% will be divided up among the movesegs...this can
       result in it taking a little longer for factories to fully heal, since
       the damage healed each moveseg is rounded down. Id that sounded
       confusing, it isn't: just wait patiently for three updates or so and the
       factory will be ready. There's nothing you can do to speed this up, and
       nothing will slow it down short of somebody shooting the factory.
    g) When the factory is healed...congrats! You can produce ships! To do this,
       change scope into the factory again and type "build". Poof! A new ship!
       Alternately, you can type "build (number)" to build (number) ships at
       once. Beats typing "build" fifty times, let me tell you.

  3) Modifying ships: Ok, so you're in the factory's scope, you've orded it to
     "make" a type of ship...now what? Now you learn the joys of the "modify"
     command ("mod" for short). Type "make". You'll see a printout of the ship's
     stats. The good news is that you can modify almost every single one of
     those stats! "But why", you ask, "would I want to do that?" Well, besides
     the obvious benefits of, for instance, adding extra fuel or crew to a ship,
     or increasing the number of guns...you can take features OFF of a ship to
     decrease its effective tech level. This means you can be building
     Destroyers, Tankers, and Cargo ships literally dozens of updates before
     Tech 100. Granted, they will be comparatively wimpy for their class, but
     they can still be effective. The Tanker, for instance, is often used as a
     "jumpship". Hyperdrive tech comes along at tech 50, but there generally
     aren't any good long-range hyperdrive craft at that tech level. However, by
     dropping a few thousand Fuel Capacity form a Tanker, and dropping its
     Destruct and Guns to lower levels, and lowering the crew...voila. A Tech 50
     Tanker, with Hyperdrive, and with 5 hangers...that's enough to carry 4
     shuttles and a space telescope. This means that you can jump into a system,
     use the space telescope to examine all the planets, and send shuttles to
     the 4 best planets right away. Which, trust me, is a HELL of a lot faster
     than messing around with explorers.

Note: Some versions of gb have a ship type called the "Light Carrier". The
symbol is "j". These tend to be _extremely_ effective ships, so if you see them
in the came you may want to experiment between those and Tankers and see which
gives the better bang for your buck.

Which reminds me...not all ship types are created equal, nor are all ship types
used for their intended purpose. For instance, Cargo Ships often make mighty
good warships, particularly at low tech; whereas the usefulness of Destroyers
tends to be limited by their low fuel capacity (which limits jump range). The
moral of this story is: experiment! I like to have one factory on my homeworld
which I never, ever turn on. I just use it as a "research lab" of
sorts...basically just change scopes, "make" a ship type, modify it, "make" a
new ship type, etc...this gives me an idea of what sorts of ships I'm capable of
building. Note: "make" and "build" are not the same thing. I don't mean to imply
that I'm actually _building_ all these different ship types. Using "make" is
like giving the factory a set of blueprints; "modify" modifies those blueprints;
ordering the factory on sets up the machinery to make the ship specified by the
blueprints; "build" actually builds the ships.

Which reminds me: how Modify works. Just type "help modify" and it'll tell you
the commands, but, in short, "mod (feature) (new value)" is the formula. "Mod
fuel 100" changes the blueprints so that the new ship design will have 100 fuel.

Keep an eye on two things above all else: Tech and Cost. Cost is how many
Resources it will take to build one of these. Tech is the tech level you'll have
to be at before you can _build_ one. Note that you can order the factory on even
if you can't build the design it is set to!

Yes, this means that my race at tech 10, can design a tech 100 ship (a shuttle
that carries a billion crew for instance). I can even order the factory
"on". However, even after the factory is fully repaired I won't be able to build
the ship design until I reach tech 100.

A corollary to this is: never ever forget it takes 3 updates for the factory to
come online. This means you can always get away with designing ships for tech
levels 3 updates away. Let's say you have an IQ of 200, which is fairly normal
for a "techie" race. This means you will be gaining 2 tech per turn (200 / 100 =
2).  So even if you are only at Tech 24 now, you can design a Tech 30 ship and
order the factory on, because by the time the factory heals and comes online you
will have reached tech 30. Be careful; nothing is more annoying than having an
unbuildable Tech 30.1 design while your race is at Tech 30; err on the side of
caution.

One final note: you can "upgrade" ships after they are built. This costs
resources, and those resources HAVE to be IN the ship. So, if you ever want to
be able to upgrade a ship, leave some of the cargo capacity when you "modify"
the design. This isn't all that important for "throwaway" ships, but it is a
good idea for those multi-hundred-resources jumpships and warships. Besides, who
knows when it'll come in handy.

  ships -- Presentation of standard type ships in GB

__Spore Pod__
  This is a small see pod grown by a mesomorphic race and is used primarily to
colonize other planets. A Pod can be landed like a normal ship upon reaching a
destination. However, a Pod can also be warmed by a star, causing it to explode,
possibly seeding a random planet in that star system. Deterioration builds up in
a Pod and will eventually cause it to decay. Pods usually last around four
updates.
  Some notes: You cannot unload crew or military from a pod; You cannot assault
other ships with a pod; You cannot change the destination of a pod once it is on
its way.

__Shuttle__
  This is a small, short-range spacecraft, intended for exploration and
shuttling things between ground and orbit. This ship is also useful for
assembling other ships in space, as resources can be transferred from another
ship using the load command until it is carrying more than the maximum
cargo. The Shuttle, however, cannot take off or land with this cargo. Shuttles
are one of the few classes of ships that can construct other ships. They have
one light gun for self defense and no armor.

__Carrier__
  Carriers have huge hangers, enabling them to carry and support many companion
ships. Any real battle group will be equipped with one of these massive
machines. They are not amazingly armored, but are armed about equivalent to a
Battleship. These ships are so large, they can not land on planets and must be
built in space. If you must tangle with a Carrier...be sure that you have PLENTY
of warships to do it with. These guys are nasty; they can carry about 7 cruisers
all by themselves! This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be
completed manually.

__Dreadnaught__
  This ship is the largest and best armored combat vessel. With twice the
gunpower of the Battleship and heavy-duty armor, the Dreadnaught makes an
excellent flagship for any navy. this ship is built with 48%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Battleship__
  Although not quite the mighty Dreadnaught, the Battleship is the basic heavy
class combat ship. With its excellent armor and heavy firepower, this ship works
will for general-purpose assaults, and fleet duty. This ship is built with 48%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Interceptor__
  this ship is a step above the Destroyer. Although equipped with the same
armor, the Interceptor has more firepower and excellent range via its large fuel
capacity, which can even outdistance a standard Cruiser class ship. An
Interceptor is very fast, it's like the 'Porsche' of the battlefield and an
excellent choice for lengthy, but potentially dangerous patrols. This ship is
built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Cruiser__
  This ship is a medium class escort/battle vessel. Although without the range
of the Interceptor, the Cruiser boasts heavy caliber firepower and substantially
more armor. These ships can provide a strong foundation for a powerful
fleet. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed
manually.

__Destroyer__
  This ship is the smallest of the combat ships. With moderate arms and armor,
this ship can provide decent star system security at the lower technology
levels, and later can be produced en masse to fill in a fleet. It is always a
good choice for escort duty. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction
must be completed manually.

__Fighter Group__
  The Fighter Group is a quick, high power weapon when utilized correctly. Their
short range necessitates transport ships, but the tactical advantage these ships
can create make them indispensable assets in combat. Fighter Groups represent up
to five individual craft at full strength. This interpretation, however, is
unimportant with the scale of the game.

__Explorer__
  This is a small and fast exploration craft with some armor. It has increased
range over shuttle and it's the smallest shiptype capable to jump. It is more
heavily armed than shuttle. This is not a ship to tangle with warships, although
it is rather ideal for armed recon. This ship is built with 48%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Space Habitat__
  This is a residential platform, a space colony. It can be used to manufacture
other ships, as well as safeguard your race against extinction, if you choose to
send it into interstellar space as an insurance measure. Habitats can build any
ship a warship is able to, and may also build this ship types: X, H, S, O, M, @,
:, F, T, and W. Both Factories (F) and Weapon Plants (W) may be operated in the
hanger area of a Habitat. They are equipped with defensive strength arms and
armor.
  Habitats also have sophisticated manufacturing and refining equipment,
enabling the Habitat to convert fuel into resources (typically at 20 fuel per
resource), in proportion to the number of people staffing it. To facilitate the
conversion, they also gather fuel at gas giants at a high rate, normally 200
fuel units per update. The Habitat must be switched on with the order command
before it will produce resources. Habitats are the only ships in which citizens
feel comfortable enough to reproduce freely. This ship is build with 72%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Space Station__
  This is an orbital installation useful as a military depot as well as a
perimeter planetary defense base. They do not pack heavy firepower, though, and
have little armor. It can build any ships that warships or shuttles can build.
  Stations are unusual in that they can repair themselves for free, without
charging resources. Ships docked with or landed on a station can also take
advantage of this feature. This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must
be completed manually.

__Orbital Assault Platform__
  This is a huge station-like construction, bristling with firepower. It's
horribly impressive weaponry system makes it useful for enslaving recalcitrant
worlds (with the 'enslave' command). It can also be used for constructing other
ships as can shuttles and habitats, however it cannot reproduce citizens or
manufacture resources. An OAP must be built in space and is too large to be
landed on a planet. This ship is built with 72% damage. Construction must be
completed manually.

__Cargo Ship__
  A basic all-purpose transport ship, a cargo ship has long range capability,
but little defensive capability. Escort ships are a definite must when using
these ships in volatile areas.

__Tanker__
  This ship can carry large amounts of fuel and moderate amounts of other
commodities. In addition, it can also collect fuel at a high rate, which is one
fifth of tanker's fuel capacity, by orbiting a gas giant. They have very small
gunnery strengths and light armor, but since they are relatively huge they have
lot of staminal strength against attacks.

__Mine Fields__
  This device is a proximity mine, exploding on contact with enemy ships or, if
set with the 'order' command, showering them with deadly radiation. It gives
damage appropriate to the amount of destructive capacity it is
carrying. Affected ships, when irradiated, can become periodically immobile;
each turn, an affected ship's crew is reduced by 20%. The mine can be
armed/disarmed with 'order', and its trigger radius also altered with the
'order' command.
  Alien space mines are difficult to detect. They are invisible on the solar
system maps but can be detected with the 'tactical' command. Their precise
locations may be difficult to triangulate. They also possess a high defense
strength since they are small object and difficult to hit nonetheless find. A
Mine Sweeper can facilitate rooting out these dangerous objects.
  Mines are triggered by ships moving inside of their assigned trigger radius,
or by owner using detonate command. If a ship is within the trigger radius the
ship is evaluated as to whether the mine is in fact triggered. The chance of
triggering the mine is proportional to the size of the ship. For example, a ship
with a size 30 the trigger odd is 2 * 30 = 60% chance. Smaller ships are less
likely to trigger the mines. These are evaluated for each ship in each mine's
radius each update.

__Space Mirror__
  This is a large plane of reflecting material, suitable for altering the
ambient temperature of a planet if aimed at one (via the 'order' command). The
intensity of the reflected beam can also be set with 'order'. The intensity is
the maximum temperature rise of the planet in degrees; this amount may be
reduced by damage to the Mirror or by range.
  A Space Mirror may also be used as a weapon if aimed at a ship. The damage
done to the ship is proportional to the intensity set on the Mirror and
inversely related to the target's size and the range to the target. This ship
also has attitude jets for maneuvering. This ship is built with 72%
damage. Construction must be complete manually.

__Space Telescope__
  This is a space-based astronomical facility, with fuel and engines for
launching it into orbit. It has a much longer range than a ground-based
telescope. The tech level of a race determines the telescope's range at build
time. Ranges for telescopes built before the next update are listed in a race's
profile.

__Ground Telescope__
  This is a ground-based astronomical facility. It is able to survey the nearest
planets for mapping purposes. The tech level of a race determines the
telescope's range at build time. Ranges for telescopes built before the next
update are listed in a race's profile. (No...placing it on mountain areas does
not increase it's range). Usage: order / aim <target planet>

__Tractor/Repulsor Beam__
  When this device can be aimed at a ship or planet and activated, it will
attract/repel the other object. Newton's Law, however, requires that the smaller
of the two objects move more than the larger. (This is a non-functional device.)

__Atmosphere Processor__
  This is a large machine (of the type in _Aliens_) that sucks in the atmosphere
of a planet, converting it to the type of air preferred by its owner. You must
load crew into these objects for them to operate. The device also must be
activated with the order command. Larger planets take longer to convert than
smaller planets. The Processor uses three fuel per turn.
** INFO only. Ship superceeded by the Infrastructure Machine (i) **

__Dust Canister__
  This is a small canister of light-absorbing dust. When launched it will spread
into the atmosphere of the planet, lowering its ambient temperature by ten
degrees per update. Multiple Dust Canisters have a cumulative effect, but the
temperature of a planet can not be lowered by more than 100 degrees. This can be
used for terraforming purposes, when the temperature is too high for
comfort. The dust disperses after 80 turns.

__Greenhouse Gases__
  This device produces large amounts of greenhouse cases when launched in the
atmosphere of a planet, raising the temperature near the planet surface by ten
degrees per update. Launching more than one will warm the planet faster, but the
temperature of a planet can not be raised by more than 100 degrees. This can be
used for terraforming purposes, when the temperature is too low for comfort. The
gases disperse after 80 turns.

__Governmental Center__
  This represents the seat of government of an entire civilization. Although
superficially a ship, it is not designed to be moved; if your capitol is not
landed on a planet, it produces no action points. However it can be launched and
landed like any other ship should an emergency arise. If a capitol is destroyed
another one must be designated with the 'capitol' command. Note that it is
possible to maintain more than one government center; this has no benefit beyond
serving as a backup in the case of destruction of the current capitol. This ship
is build with 72% damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Orbital Mind Control Laser__
  This device, when aimed at a ship, produces resonating vibrations within the
ship's hull, to cause the mental attitude of the crew to be altered. The crew's
response to influence is dependent on the armor of the affected ship, becoming
more and more difficult for the vibrations to be produced as the target ship's
armor increases. The laser has a range similar to the player's gun range.
  Response can be toggled by the "desired response" register in the order
command: from convincing the crew to trigger their aggressive response and kill
each other, to converting them to sympathy for your race and its motivations;
each response has a percentage chance of conversion.
  The orbital mind-control lasers are currently only effective on planets, and
have one setting: to suppress emotion, which causes no fighting or migrations to
take place.

__Toxic Waste Container__
  This is a sealed container used to store environmental poisons. When toxicity
of a planet becomes too high, constructing one of these containers will reduce
the poison level by 20%. If the container is breached, however, the toxic waste
inside will escape.

__Space Probe__
  This device is used to sight positions of enemy fleets. The ship is robotic
and requires no crew, but reports data from its explorations to the building
race as if it were manned. It is extremely fast and can be useful for analyzing
the strategic deployments of enemy ships.

__Gamma Ray Laser__
  This device shoots medium gun shots or deadly streams of radiation at its
target when fired. It uses destructive capacity in the same manner for both
guns. Radiation is not accumulated in target ships; if a ship's radiation level
is 10, only a more powerful shot from the laser may increase the radiation
level. A weaker shot will have no effect at all.
  Radiation does not kill immediately, but will kill off 20% of the ship's
population each update. Each movement segment, a ship may have a chance of
becoming inactive due to the radiation levels in the ship. this ship is built
with 72% damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Factory__
  A Factory is built to produce other ships. To see a list of other ships which
must be built in a Factory, see the help topic 'build'. After being built,
descend to the ship's scope and specify the ship type this Factory will be able
to produce with the 'make' command. The stats of the ship to be produced can
then be modified by using the 'modify' command. Finally, the Factory must be
ordered online with the 'order' command. Once activated it cannot be turned off,
nor can the specification of the ships it is to manufacture be altered in any
way.
  A Factory is built with 48% damage. This represents the time it will take to
start up production. Damage will repair itself during movement segments
automatically. To begin repairing however the ship must first be ordered
'on'. See 'help build' for more information regarding factories.

__Terraforming Device__
  This device alters the surface of a planet to better suit its owner. Once
activated and given a move command (see the command 'order' for more help), the
Terraforming Device moves each update to a new position, altering sectors as it
goes.
  It will move first, then terraform, so that it will not destroy the sector on
which it was built. Any sector terraformed will have its efficiency and
mobilization count reduced to 0. Terraformers will terraform sectors owned by
other players but civilians and military are not destroyed, owner is not changed
and victims receive a warning message. 'Gas' sectors can not be terraformed to
any other type of sector, but not vice versa. Terraforming requires three fuel
per update. Terraforming can increase the toxicity level of a planet.

__Audio-Vibratory-Physio-Molecular Transport Device__
  This device has a hopper for the loading of material. When it detects the
presence of something in the hopper, it will transport this material into the
hopper of its target device. The target device can be specified with the 'order'
command.
  You should specify the number of the receiving Transporter. If the target ship
is set to '0' cargo will not be transported anywhere and will remain in the
hopper. Both the sending and target Transporters must be landed and undamaged to
transport material. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be
completed manually.

__Missile__
  This weapon can be used to attack enemy planets or ships. In order to attack
with a missile, they must be launched and then given a destination. If the
destination is a ship it will detonate upon reaching the enemy ship. If the
destination is a planet, the missile will impact on the designated sector. See
help on 'order' for designating missile impact coordinates. A missile may be
designated to impact a specific sector, or may be allowed to randomly hit the
planet.
  A missile aimed for a planet will automatically switch its target to any
Planetary Defense Networks protecting the planet. The only automatic defense
against missiles is the ABM battery. Missiles are, needless to say, considered
to be nuclear (the default is a 10-MegaD warhead).

__Planetary Defense Network__
  These are powerful, well armored third generation planetary defense (after
gamma ray lasers) which prevent enemy players to fire at planets as long as they
are present. Before a player may attack sectors with orbiting ships, all
planetary defense systems must be eliminated. This ship is build with 72%
damage. construction must be completed manually.

__Quarry__
  This ship is used to mine resources from a sector. The amount of resource per
update mined from a sector with a Quarry is five. The disadvantage of Quarries
is not only that they will reduce the fertility of a sector by the amount of
resources produced, but they also will turn the sector into waste and increase
the toxicity on the planet. Mining requires two fuel per update.
NOTE: This is useful ship only if resource deposits are infinite, so newbies ask
      the deity about that before building a Quarry.

__Space Plow__
  This type of ship allows you to increase the fertility of sectors. Once
activated and given a move command (see the command 'order' for more help), a
fully manned and undamaged plow will increase the fertility of each sector
traversed by 10%. If it reaches the north or south of the planet map, it will
bounce off and continue. There is also a hop option to move a plow automatically
into own low fertility sector when sector's fertility reaches wanted level
(ordered with limit command). The Space Plow uses two fuel per update. Plowing
can increase the toxicity on a planet.
** INFO only. Ship superceeded by the Infrastructure Machine (i) **

__Dome__
  This ship can be used to increase sector efficiencies. At maximum crew the
efficiency an undamaged Dome can increase the efficiency by 5% per update. A
Dome must be switched on to be effective. If a Dome is set to autoscrap (with
the 'order' command), the Dome will be automatically scrapped upon reaching a
sector efficiency of 100%. There is a hop option for Dome to make it
automatically hop into own low efficiency sector when sector's efficiency
reaches wanted level (ordered with limit command). A Dome uses one resource per
update.
** INFO only. ship superceeded by the Infrastructure Machine (i) **

__Weapons Plant__
  This installation produces destruct. Players feed the plant resources and
fuel, and these are converted into destruct during each update. Each destruct
produced costs one fuel and one resource point. The maximum amount of destruct a
fully manned and undamaged plant can produce in one update is given by the
owner's current technology divided by two. This ship is built with 72%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Space Port__
  This represents a facility set up for merchant shipping. This is its sole
function and therefore has little armor and no weapons. In order to buy or sell
from a planet, you must have one of these, or a ship with port abilities in an
undamaged state there. Other than the Space Port, the only other ships available
to conduct merchant transactions are: @, H, and S. This ship is built with 72%
damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Anti-Ballistic Missile Battery__
  This unit represents a battery of guns which can be used to attempt to down
incoming alien missiles. If activated, each battery will fire at the
predesignated salvo strength at each missile in orbit around the planet it is
based upon during each update. The defensive fire is evaluated after missile
movement, but before impact is evaluated. ABMs represent a last line of defense
against missile attacks and are executed automatically. the more batteries a
planet has the more chance of intercepting an incoming missile. This ship is
build with 48% damage. construction must be completed manually.

__AFV__
  This machine is a land based Armored Fighting Vehicle. These type of ships may
fire on other ships if adjacent. They may also bombard adjacent sectors. AFVs
may only attack other landed ships. AFVs can be moved using the 'walk' command.
NOTE: These are weaker than they look.

__Bunker__
  A heavily fortified position. Use it to store supplies and AFVs in, as well as
offering a haven for ships. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction
must be completed manually.

__Lander__
  A heavily armored planetary assault ship. This carries a large crew, with
decent hanger for transporting AFVs. With its heavy armor it can successfully
survive planetary defense fire enough to establish a significantly large landing
party on a planet. It also carries plenty of firepower for bombarding runs. The
Lander is quite slow, however. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction
must be completed manually.

__Mine Sweeper__
  A medium armored and armed ship, capable of seeking (automatically) out mines
and destroying them before other ships come in contact with them. The Sweeper is
not particularly fast, but it has a kind of shotgun cannons. These cannons give
better hit probability against mines than cannons of any other ship. The Sweeper
is best used when loaded into a faster ship and sent out before exploring an
unknown system. A mine sweeper's % chance to detect the mine is equal to:
    chance % = 5 + (2 * sqrt(tech))
This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed manually.

__Colonizer__
  An unarmed, lightly armored recon ship, with a large crew compartment, and
ample resource space, this ship is perfect for scouting out prospective homes
for your race. This ship is built with 20% damage. Construction must be
completed manually.

__Light Carrier__
  This is a low tech, small, carrier, useful for transporting shuttles or domes
to your colonies. They have light armor, and only minimal guns for defensive
purposes. This ship is built with 48% damage. Construction must be completed
manually.

__Corvette__
  The Corvette is designed to perform light system defense duties. It has no
capability for hyperdrive, nor large cargo, fuel, or crew spaces which would
make it a good choice for colonization. Its mission is to ensure system
security, not to go boldly where no one has gone before.

__Super Pod__
  Super Pods are like the normal pods except it is slightly faster and seeds
sectors in star systems three times more likely.

__Infrastructure Machine__
  This is a machine you build to increase efficiency and fertilization of the
planet's sectors. It can also transform your atmosphere. The machine will spend
a high proportion of effort on sectors with crystals or higher than average
resources. You have to have atmos tech to use that feature. You tell it what to
do with the order command. Orders are:
    order <shipno> inf eff <setting>   - Cost is 1 res per setting
    order <shipno> inf fert <setting>  - Cost is 2 fuel per setting
    order <shipno> inf atmos <setting> - Cost is 3 fuel per setting
Machine cost per update is 1/2 of total settings in res for eff and 1/2 total
fuel settings for fert and atmos. Example:
    order 111 inf eff 20
This device must be turned on.

__Science Research Center (SETI)__
  This is a huge scientific research center that provides your race with two
benefits. First, a research center increases the speed at which your race gains
technology. The more research centers you have, the more tech you will gain,
although gains are logarithmic. For instance, having 100 SETIs will not increase
your tech gains 100 times. Second, science research centers are the only devices
that can detect, albeit somewhat unreliably, a cloaked ship.
  In a scrape, you can order a SETI to overload its telescope arrays and fire at
another ship much like a laser. Doing so requires laser and crystal
technology. However, using a SETI in this manner will cause severe damage to the
center and can result in its destruction.
  Science research centers require fuel and resources to work, and must be
turned on. Furthermore, the research station will only produce tech on planets
with a non-zero tech investment.

__Frigate__
  The Frigate will defend fleets against any missiles directed at ships in the
fleet. Frigates, like mine sweepers, detect the subtle sub-ether emanations
missiles give off just as they begin to explode. The more Frigates a fleet has
in its number, the more safe every ship in the fleet becomes. Unfortunately,
Frigates are not fool-proof, even in great numbers.

__Refinery__
  This installation produces fuel. Players feed the plant resources, and these
are converted into fuel during each update. Each fuel produced costs 1 resource
point. The maximum of fuel a refinery can produce is related to a race's
technology divided by two. Refineries produce a great deal of waste and promote
the greenhouse effect on the planet.

__Von Neumann Machine__
  VNs are excellent strip mining machines. They can quickly produce resources
from a sector, but their methods are crude and destructive. What is left behind
is an empty, scarred, and poisoned sector unfit for life.
  They are robotic and self-replicating. First generation VNs are under the
builder's control. However, when a VN produces offspring, the new VN is not
controlled by the original owner. Furthermore, any VN left on its own long
enough will eventually become rogue.
  VNs, which their group mind, remember who has destroyed them and attempt to
exact revenge by building Berserkers, death machines that attempt to hunt down
players they are angry at. You may want to consider it before purchasing these
things, as they can get rather out of hand...

__Berserker__
  This is a robotic ship built by the Von Neumann Machines as part of their
revenge program against players who have destroyed too many of their ships. It
is very well-armed, with about the capabilities of a dreadnaught. When targeted
at an individual player, it heads to the area where the last VNs were destroyed,
and attempts to wipe out colonies and ships belonging to the offending player
until one or the other is destroyed. It does not build copies of itself, but it
can perform self-repair and re-arm itself when needed. It is rumored that there
is a berserker control code that can be used to take charge of the machines...

__Berserker Auto-Factory__

__The Dreaded Space Ameoba__
  What the hell is a Space Ameoba? A Space Ameoba is a huge single-celled
create that flies through the universe searching for food. What does it eat?
Biomass. The Space Ameoba searches out planets of high biomass. What does it do
when it finds a planet of high biomass? It consumes. And consumes. a Space
Ameoba will continue to consume biomass from a planet until it is "full". It
will then leave for the depths of space again.

__Godship__
  This entity pulsates, throbs with power. Don't mess with it. They are usually
named with names appropriate to their purpose...Watcher would mean observation
duties. Bulldozer might mean moving cargo...Destructor means run for your
life...etc.

__Oceanic Transport Fleet__
  This is an equivalent to the ground transport fleet, however it represents a
fleet of ocean-going ships. This fleet can only move over water, at a cost of 1
fuel point, however it can 'dock' with a different type of sector, as long as it
border an ocean sector.
(This device has not been programmed)

__Dirigible Transport Fleet__
  This is a fleet of lighter-than-air vehicles. It costs more resources to
assemble and cannot hold as much as the other planetary transport types, but it
is free to roam over the surface of any planet (provided, of course, that the
planet has an atmosphere).
(This device has not bee programmed)

& speed

{{CONCEPT}}
  speed -- How fast ships travel through space

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  Speed reflects a ship's ability to move through the space. The bigger speed
the ship has the faster it goes. Usually, the speed is one critical factor when
you design your ships. Watching a slow ship to reach its destination is
frustrating. The distance covered with each speed can be calculated with a
following formula:
    distance = SPEED * MOVEMENT LEVEL
where:
    SPEED corresponds to ship's speed, that is if the speed of the ship is 2 the
    SPEED is 2.

    MOVEMENT LEVEL depends from when where your ship starts its move. This
    reflects the fact that if you maneuver near planets you will not want to use
    the cruising speed of the universe (and hit the planet). MOVEMENT LEVEL is
    given by:
        universe level = 400
        system level = 100
        planet level = 50

Note: Damaged ships move slower proportional to their damage.

-segment-
To calculate the distance ship moves in ONE SEGMENT you need to divide MOVEMENT
LEVEL by the number of segments:
Example:
  for 3 segments per update, MOVEMENT LEVEL is 400, 100, or 50
  for 4 segments per update, MOVEMENT LEVEL is 300, 75, or 37.5
The speed of the ship has also an effect on other things such as firing and fuel
usage.

& stockpile

{{CONCEPT}}
  stockpile -- Automatic stockpile usage

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  TKYs will now use planetary stockpile so basically you don't have to load res
of fuel or use thresholding with them - they'll just take everything they need
from stockpile. Anyhow because they operate before production cycle in updates
you should look after that there is enough resources for _all_ landed ships that
you could just use thresholding which is easier I think). this one thing which
might be done other way. i.e. planetary production first and ship update
then. Stockpile usage can be toggled using 'order TKY stockpile [on|off]'.

& update

{{CONCEPT}}
  update -- One turn of game

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  An update is a "glorified move seg". Basically, everything that happens in a
move seg happens here PLUS the following:
    - Tax collecting and maintain expenses paying.
    - Resource, fuel, destruction, crystal a toxic waste production.
    - Colony population growth.
    - Sector and atmosphere developing.
    - Ships attempting hyperspace jumps either jump or charge in increments
      towards a level where they can jump.
    - Marketing.
  What this translates to is this: the pace of the game depends almost entirely
on how often these updates occur. There will always be a given number of move
segs (usually anywhere from 2 to 6) between updates, but updates are the real
pulse of the game. Also, you should note that the period right after updates is
usually when the most frantic action in the game takes place.
  This is important when choosing what game you wish to play in. For example, if
you live over in Europe and the update schedule is such that updates always
occur at 4 am for you, you might want to pass on the game. If you aren't on at
updates, enemies often get the chance of jump into your system and start
attacking while you aren't on to defend yourself. This can have disastrous
effects.
  This clears up a bit what is happening during updates to TKY type ships:
    * Process move orders (only T and K)
    * Hop if sector is ready and autoscrap if hop fails
    * Do your things to sector
    * autoscrap Y's

& wormholes

{{CONCEPT}}
  wormholes -- Space-time anomaly

{{DESCRIPTION}}
  Wormholes were originally created for the J&H games and have been brought into
the current GB+ code. They are implemented as special kinds of planets,
appearing as weird asteroids. To traverse them simply land on them. Once you
have attained wormhole tech level (see: techlevel) you can see them for what
they are. Regardless if you can identify them correctly or not they will work
the same. Traversing wormholes will damage your ship based both on the distance
the wormhole covers and how far the ship's tech level is below the wormhole tech
level, a ship built at (or above) the wormhole tech level may traverse wormholes
without risk of damage.
  Whether or not wormholes are present (and how many) depends upon the options
your deity selected upon creating the universe.
