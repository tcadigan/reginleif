GB+ 6.0a (Released: 03/01/05)

 Started with GB+ server version HUT-5.1.1 as a codebase. -mfw

 New features:

 + Implemented CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) so plain-text
   passwords are not passed across the network. Passwords are MD5 now.
 + Added Von Neumann machines from original GB (with changes and bug fixes).
 + Implemented 'fleets', an idea from HAP. However, this implementation is
   accomplished in a difference manner.
 + Wrote guardian program to launch GB server and keep it running in case of
   crash. Manages core files and emails GB admin.
 + Wormholes from the Treehouse code (with some changes and bug fixes).
 + Added the 'garbled communication' feature from HAP (almost identically). Uses
   words from Klingon dictionary for fun.
 + SETI ship from HAP, will this be useful? (testing)
 + Changed cloak algorithm so cloaking only occurs during segments/updates
 + Frigates and Gunboats (renamed Corvettes) from HAP
 + Many changes to csp_orbit to work with gbII changes.
 + Finished coding the channel command left unfinished from original GB.
 + Added smashup algorithm to makeplanet from orginal GB. However, this really
   is not needed. I've left it available as an option to makeuniv.

 + Created @last to show the last IP and time for a Race/Gov connection.
 + Added additional provisions for color characters on map and orbit.
 + Wrote help pages for each God command and CSP: help admin

   may also display the bug report with the 'bug report' now.

 + Wrote gbctl script to control starting/stopping/status of all daemons.
 + AP cost for Race, Gov, Planet, and Star (if allowed) name changes.

 + Added HAP's refinery, but probably should be part of Infrastructure now.
 + Population may revolt due to too-high taxes.
 + Added the Dreaded Space Amoeba from original GB (needs more testing).
 + Updated the exam.dat file. Whew!
 + Help pages for shout, exship, and psmap.
 + Added smart guns from HAP (needs more testing, see 'order' command).
 + The exship command now shows the Vns mind attributes.
 + Planets start with 0 popn, gov ship must be unloaded to populate planet.
 + The makeuniv program now outputs to universe.txt by default.
 + Automated backup scheduling (added this because I'm lazy).

 Bug fixes:

 + pod.c: Meso propagation bug fix, could have ended up X+1.
 + exploration() now gives error if no argument is given.
 + Got rid of Dhuttle, it was an inside joke for HUT games.

   help for options not available in the current mode.
 + Fixed '\c' problems in Makefile. GNU make choked on these.
 + Renamed executables GB -> GB_server; racegen -> GB_racegen; guardian ->
   GB_guardian. This is just for 'ps -aef | grep GB' convenience.
 + 'already logged in' message now works. Added cleardes() and shutdown_socket().
 + 'fixed @boot command to boot the correct descriptor (augmenting 'which').

   and/or stars (if allowed).
