Openglad 0.97:
         Not many groundbreaking changes. Openglad-enhanced was branched, so
         this is not a bugfix-only branch, so don't expect major changes.

         However, the game should be more stable and eat up less ram now :-)

Openglad 0.95:
         This is a fully functional release. All the features have been
         implemented so it's a full port. Play it with your friends, family,
         pets, etc...
