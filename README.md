# Terrain

Date of origin: 2006

Original source: http://www.shamusyoung.com/files/terrain_source.zip

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Port the Windows specific parts to Linux [TBD]

3) Get it to compile [TBD]

4) Likely the above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

As seen in the list above this is a Windows application. I didn't see a Linux one floating around and it appears that most is in (albeit rather poor) OpenGL.
