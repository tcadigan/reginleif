# Hack 1.0

Date of origin: 1985

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/hack_1.0.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/hack_1.0)

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [Done]

2) Get it to compile [DONE]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [WIP]

Notes:

This is one of the first generation rogue-like games (arguably THE one). This has been a serious pain to do, they implemented some rather crazy control (label jumping, conditionals with numerous side effects, etc.). This will take some rather serious work to get working correctly.
