Date of origin: 2009

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/pixel_city.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/pixel_city)

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [DONE]

2) Port the Windows specific parts to Linux [WIP]

3) Get it to compile [DONE]

4) Likely the above won't work right, reimplement so it does [WIP]

Notes:

Logos are going to have to be redone.

All of the keyboard handling was removed in a purge, will need to be reimplemented.

The code is a mess still, needs to be cleaned up before even thinking about getting it proper.
