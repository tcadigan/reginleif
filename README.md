# Project Euler

Once upon a time in a galaxy far far away...

I was into Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net) challenges.

These are old, and likely a sad state of code. I know that some of the solutions
were not of the quick type. At the time I wasn't as altruistic, and got online
help for a few of them.

I would certainly get back into doing these, they were awesome fun.

# UVa

Back in university I was into competitive programming.

For practice we did some of the UVa challenges
(http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php).

These as well are quite old. Likely not the best of code quality, but they got
the job done. Some of them had really exotic test cases if I remember right.

I would appreciate getting back into these. It keeps the mind sharp.
