# Omega 0.80 (0.75 ???)

Date of origin: 1991

Original source: http://www.alcyone.com/binaries/omega/omega-0.75-src.tar.gz 

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Get it to compile [TBD]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

This is one of the last "first generation" Rogue like games. There is conflicting information about what version this actually is, some sources indicate that it is 0.80, others indicate that it is 0.75. I am opting to go with 0.80.
