# Omega 0.75 (with some 0.80 mixed in)

Date of origin: 1991

Original source: http://www.alcyone.com/binaries/omega/omega-0.75-src.tar.gz 

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Get it to compile [TBD]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

This is one of the last "first generation" Rogue like games. This appears to be mostly 0.75 (beta) however there also seem to be some files that refer to it being 0.80. Based on taimestamps of files, most appear to be 0.75
