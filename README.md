# Omega 0.75

Date of origin: 1991

Original source: http://www.alcyone.com/binaries/omega/omega-0.75-src.tar.gz 

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Get it to compile [TBD]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

This is one of the last "first generation" Rogue like games. The download is mislabeled as 0.75, however all of the source indicates this is 0.80. Unfortunate indeed. From what I gather this is the second public (non-alpha) release.
