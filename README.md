# Omega 0.75

Date of origin: 1991 (I think...)

Original source: http://www.alcyone.com/binaries/omega/omega-0.75-src.tar.gz

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Get it to compile [TBD]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

This is the one of the first generation rogue-like games.
