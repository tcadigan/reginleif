[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/snobol_III.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tcadigan/snobol_III)

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [Done]

2) Get it to compile [Done]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [WIP]

Notable changes:

1) Memory allocation was using sbrk. Re-implemented using malloc. This changes how freespace was handled/tracked.
