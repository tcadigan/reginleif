# gbII 6.0

Date of origin: Last updated 2013, originally much earlier, late 1980s into the 1990s

Original source: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gbp/

Goals:

1) Re-type all source code [WIP]

2) Get it to compile [TBD]

3) Likely above won't work right, reimplement so it does [TBD]

Notes:

Wanted to take a shot at a non-rogue game. This one sounded interesting. One of the original 4X games and client-server as well! Annoyingly a tiny bit of X included (though optional), not quite sure what I will do with it yet.
