10/24/89 ************************* FIRE --- IMPORTANT **************************

         In case yo uhave been upset with the randomness in the fire routine, I
         tried to implement a change. I will do this in several stages. For the
         moment everything is completely deterministic, so look at the damages
         you do (and get) and see if you like them. Comments are appreciated. I
         will add the random factors later, I think they are necessary but hard
         for debugging. To save you a lot of experimenting, here is how it
         works:

         Ships to ships:
           effstr = (your strength) * FAC / (1 + (dist / DIST))
           currently FAC = 2, DIST = 300this

           damage = (effstr - (3 * armor)) / 2

           That's it!! Simple enough??

         Planets on planets:
           (proposed!). There will be no more firing from planets on planets, if
           you want to attack a planet you should build ships. This will
           eliminate the common trick of wasting one sector, landing and letting
           the planet destroy itself.

         Planets on ships:
           I think I will increase the planet guns back to 40 (or 60???), a
           planet should be able to vaporize anything that attacks it. Note that
           the damage on the ship will be calculated as above. These two
           changes, for the first time, might make planetary defense logical.

         Ships on planets:
           Same as before, except, you have to be there to attack. Only ORBITING
           ships will be able to attack planets. This should disallow somebody
           entering your system to wipe out your planets instantaneously.

6/29/89 - For those of you who haven't noticed, you can tell 'map' or 'orbit' to
          omit the names of ships, stars, or planets to get a look at objects
          that may be overprinting others so you can see them. do 'help map' or
          'help orbit' to see how to do this.

6/26/89 - When you order ships to go to other systems, do not specify planet
          designations until your ships arrive at the star.

6/23/89 - Just a reminder, don't build ships/objects with a '*' designation in
          front of them. They haven't been programmed and will just be a waste
          of resources.

6/22/89 - You must load fuel and crew onto a atmospheric processor 'A' to get
          them to work. See help in 'build' for details.

6/22/89 - Cargo ships, shuttle, stations, orbital assault platforms, and
          habitats can be used to construct other ships.

6/21/89 - Teletransporter devices '[' are now working.

6/9/89 - We have installed the new version of Galactic Bloodshed 1.0(osu). This
         has superior addressing and whatnot from the previous bug-ridden
         version. It has several new features. Good luck with this one.
