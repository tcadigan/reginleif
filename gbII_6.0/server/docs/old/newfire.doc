I have implemented a new firing routine. The attitude I took in implementing
these changes was minimalistic, i.e. I implemented the easiest and most
transparent coding for the changes I wanted to make. What is being run now is a
debugging version. The damage calculation is completely deterministic. this is
to allow players to judge better whether they are happy with this
implementation, comments are most welcome!!! Here is how it now works.

Ship-Ship combat:
  The data done from one ship to another is calculated in two steps:
    effstr = ((firing strength) * FAC) / (1 + (dist / RANGE))

  where FAC = 2 and RANGE = 300. This means the strength will fall by a factor
  of 2 from 0 to 300 distance units.

    damage = (Norm / BODY) * (effstr - (2 * armor))

  where NORM = 20 and BODY depends on the defending ship. Here are some BODY
  values:
    f                10
    C, d, I, c, t    30
    B, S             45
    O, D, $, H       50
    G, A, s, e, ...   5

  For a first shot form some of the combat ships (0 distance, 0 damage) this
  computes to the following damage percentages:

              at ship
         f   d   C   B   O   D
    f   78  24  22  13  12  11
    d   38  10   9   4   4   3
    C   78  24  22  13  12  11
    B  118  37  36  22  20  19
    O  198  64  62  40  36  35
    D  238  77  76  48  44  43

  Retaliation as before.

Ship-Planet:
  You are only allowed to fire at a planet when in orbit (distance < 40).

Planet-Planet:
  A common trick used to attack planets was to waste one sector and then let
  planetary defenses work against your own planet by landing and firing from the
  planet. The fix to that: The planet may no longer fire on itself, it may still
  fire on other planets if you chose to, though. If you wish to attack a planet,
  build ships!!!

Planet-Ship:
  The planet guns will be increase to 40. They had been reduced because of the
  problem mentioned above. Note, that planetary defenses are not useful!!! You
  can beef up your planet to the point where it will vaporize any ship that
  attacks it.

Ship-Planet:
  This is not the only way to attack a planet. Damage is calculated as before,
  but you may no longer attack when not in orbit. This was done, so that the
  attacker may no longer pop into the planetary system and attack
  instantaneously.

Planetary retaliation:
  I am working on something that would allow the planet to retaliate
  intelligently. It will determine the attacking ship and fire with a strength
  which will do 75% damage on the attacking ship at zero range. This is tricky
  though, so watch for strange side effects.

A note on randomness:
  Once this is tested, I will implement a 10% variation on all these
  percentiles.

Again, comments are welcome, I hope this improves the situation.

Good luck,
Wolfgang
