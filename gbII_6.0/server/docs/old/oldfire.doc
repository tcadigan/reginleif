FIRE                    Galactic Bloodshed                      FIRE

NAME
  [1] fire -- Shoot at an enemy planet or ship

SYNOPSYS
  fire

DESCRIPTION
  Fire attempts to use stockpiled destructive capacity from one place, to give
damage to another.

  Fire will prompt the user for both. The damage given is proportional to the
amount of destructive capacity used, and inversely proportional to the distance
between them and the armor class (if the defender is a ship) of the victim ship.

  If the object being fired upon is a planet fire will prompt for a sector at
which to aim; If the object being fired from is a planet, fire will ask for a
sector from which to fire (this must be a sector owned by the player, for the
target will attempt to fire back if it can). The player will be informed how
badly damaged the target is (if this is a planet, the number of sectors
destroyed). Badly damaged sectors can be rendered uninhabitable for some
time. The blast radius on the target planet is inversely proportional to the
strength of the shot and the distance between the attacker and target. Sectors
that are mobilized will be damaged to a lesser extend; a 100% mobilized sector
will be damaged 1/2 as much as a 0% mobilized sector.

  At this point the target will attempt to fire back at the originating area
(ship or sector) with twice the strength of the attacking player, if it can. If
more than one player inhabits a planet, each player that was affected by the
attack, and does not belong to the attacking player, will attempt to return fire
at twice the attacking strength.

please send me the original files and not the shar file.
it makes it much more difficult to incorporate these changes
for me. we will still converge on the same results either
way.

i have the new fire routine which has been tested and works quite well.

here is how is works.

a player fires N guns at another ship. basically, each gun is
evaluated whether it has hit or missed. after this damage is evaluated.

here is how i calculate the number of hits (N being the maximum).

there are several factors which are taken into consideration:

1: the size of the target, bigger targets are easier to hit
   (represented by body = ShipData[type][ABIL_TARGET])

2: the speed of the target and the speed of the firing ship

3: whether or not evasive maneuvers have been ordered by either
   ship (these represent erratic motions of the ships
   ordered to make the ship harder to hit)

4: the range to the target, the farther the away it is the harder it
   is to land a hit.

basically a ship at 0 range should get hit by everything and a ship
infinitely away gets 0 hits.

the hit probability/shot goes like this

hit prob = 100 / (1 + (r / factor)^2)

as r->0 hit prob = 100 and as r->infty hit prob = 0.

the square factor is a normal field of view dispersion ("radiation law")

what is factor? factor is the range where the hit prob = 50%

that is what we calculate with the other factors involved.

factor = 20 * body / (1 + firing ship evades) / (1 + target evades)
         / (1 + target speed + firing speed).

motion by either ship affects the hit probability adversely
(including evasiove actions which is 1 (yes) or 0.

a hit percentage is evaluated and each ship and the number of hits is computed.

the damage to the ship is then evaluated

damage = 30 * (hits - armor) / body.

the armor factor (Shipdata[type][ABIL_ARMOR]) represent how many
hits a ship can take per salvo without suffering any damage.
if hits > armor, the ships take damage.

the amount of % damage a ship takes depends on the size of the
vessel. a bigger ship gets less percentage damage than a small ship.
