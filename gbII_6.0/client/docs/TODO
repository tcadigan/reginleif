def x survey ; who
/x >! test.log doesn't work.

Fix up slash_commands to work better. Internal generated commands muck this up.

Fix up client_command and way output is handled. Any commands which have an
obvious start/end should be 'hidden' to reduce screen clutter.

Add something to display the end_prompt if it is the only response from the
server. Although broadcast/ann/th will mess this up.

Make an array of server command separate from client commands.

Add an at time feature.

Fix up the if() stuff to work complexly.
expression /*-+% && ||

Add the ability of assign to handle math.
assign x = x + 1
/*+-% and () should do it.
