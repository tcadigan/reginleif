 / _` | '_ \| | | |      Congratulations on selecting the second generation
| ( | | | ) | | | |      of Galactic Bloodshed clients
 \__, |_.__/___|___|

A couple quick notes.

1) This client shall be constantly changing for better or for worse.  So check
the ftp site for upgrades constantly.

2) I try to make this client compile on as many systesm as possible. If for some
reason it does not, please let me know. And also if you make any changes to get
it to compile, please tell me of the changes and I will incorporate them as
compile time options.

3) How to compile the client. Run the setup script. Just type 'setup' or
'./setup' for those who are weary and don't have . in their $PATH. Answer the
questions as best you can. If you are unsure of how to answer the question, then
just choose the default (hit return). After answering the questions, pray and
hope the client compiles nicely. If not, please be descriptive about the problem
and if possible, include the make output.

4) Also, you may preset certain commands in a .gbrc found in your $HOME
directory. This file is generated by using the savef command while running the
client. Any changes to the default settings of the client will be saved for
future loading. Things like set options, crypts, binds, defs, and others. Read
the help file for a more complete description.

You can predefine the location of the .grbc file through the environmental
variable GBRC. If it is defined, the client will try to open and load this file
instead of the $HOME/.gbrc.

5) If you are going to use it on an X environment, you may want to make the
client with the XMAP option defined. This is _UNSUPPORTED_ by me, it is
supported by sander@engin.umich.edu. I have NOTHING to do with it what so
ever. I don't know X and I do NOT have access to an X mchine.

6) Just type 'setup'. Follow the direction and you should get gbII.

How to use gbII you ask?

Simple. Just type 'gbII'.

The full syntax for gbII is:

gbII [adehlrsvE?] [-e<filename] [-i<filename>]
     [-V<server_version#>] [host | nick] [port]

        -a              Toggles autologin
        -f              Fast startup. Do not read GBRC(~/.gbrc by default)
        -d              Toggles disply_from_top
        -h              This help screen
        -l              Does a listname command and exits
        -r              Toggles repeat_connect
        -s              Toggle login_suppress
        -?              This help screen
        -v              Prints out client version and exits
        -E              Edit mode. Enters gbII, without connectint to a game
        -R              Toggles raw mode
        -e<filename>    Will use <filename> as a script file for reading input
        -i<filename>    Will start gbII with filename as an init file
        -V<version#>    For backwards compatibility (currently not used)
        host            Host site to connect to
        nick            Use this game entry to find for connection
        port            Port to connect on


        All of these command line arguments are optional.

        You may define the environment variables GBHOST and GBPORT.
        (for some UNIX that is setenv GBHOST 'name')

7) There is on-line help for the client. Type 'helpc' (help is reserved by the
server)

8) If you have a problem in compiling or a problem with the client then please
fill out the file BUGREPORT and mail this to me email address list in the file.

Please send all modifications, bug, suggestions, or criticisms to
