gbII 2.5.3

  Hopefully full ANSI complaint. Any problems, _please_ let me know!

gbII 2.5.4

  Fix some problems and made login cleaner for older servers. Also fixes a
  problem with scope prompts on older servers.
  
gbII 2.6.0 (Released: 2005-03-01)

  Started with gbII client version 2.5.4 as a codebase. -mfw

  New Features:

  + Implemented CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) method, if
    the server is running CHAP plain-test passwords will not be passed across
    the network. Passwords are MD5 now.
  + Applied XMAP patch and added commands to activate and deactivate it.
  + Added CSP orbit functionality (some CSP format changes for this).
  + Integrated psmap code, dumps to file and/or displays using ghostview.
  + Added CSP_PAUSE (pauses display scrolling)
  + Wrote fuse command, gets data via CSP_SHIPDUMP_STATUS and can plot the
    results using gnuplot.
  + Now supports ANSI color (set ansi on).
  + Changes to 'setup' to handle Linux and ask about XMAP.
  + added emot type to cr, loadf, and proc commands.

  Bug Fixes:

  + Fixed (I think), multiple login attempts and failures, was dying after 2nd
    login attempt whether or not the password was correct.
  + Fixed handling of nova and mirror array.
  + Appending newline in gbsend() now, no need for extra gb_send("\n")
  + Changes to handling of racegen connections
  + Fixed multiple socket descriptor bugs when using 'connect' in .gbrc

gbII 2.6.1 (Released: 2006-09-15)

  + Scope prompts are now silently eaten
  + Arrow and Function keys are now bindable
  + Setup option for Windows environment (Cygwin)
  + Supports dispatch messaging
  + Dynamic memory allocation for cspr_orbit()
  + Lots of changes to code to be 'gcc -Wall' friendly
  + Can dynamically adjust to window size changes
  + Added additional discoveries from GB+ server
  + Faster cspr_orbit() algorithm

  Bug Fixes:

  + Fixed client_hash memory problem (added memset)
  + changed psmap, it was croping the left in small galaxies
  + Fixed stability display in orbit map, now accounts for unknown stability
  + Correct positioning problems of csp orbit at planetary scope
  + Map formatting problems
