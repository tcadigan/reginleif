Changes by Rich Fitzgerald (fits@rsj.harvard.edu) to xmap.c version 2.1.0
by Scott Anderson:

As of 1992-11-07:

  Added geography option to graph type list.

  Removed input window blinking with each keystroke. Now only updates
  effects of last keystroke.

  Added sector data display.

  Added option for turning xmap off (e.g. for large gas giants).

  Added xorbit, with option to plot items in reverse order and to plot
  ships only.

  Fixed problem with scopes for analysis, survey, and report buttons.

  Added scoping to map command - works for planets, not for
  orbits. (Required modifications to command.h for meshing into gbII
  2.4.5)

  Added map update support for move and deploy. Pings origin and
  destination sector if it's an assault to get proper sector stats.

1992-11-09

  Rewrote map_move and modified button_release to allow wrap in x
  direction. Modify xmap_deploy to remove 'X' character if no troops
  left nad no ships to show, and show 'X' in new sector if no ships
  there. Made 6x13 font explicit in sec_text_gc and all map_win gc's.

1992-11-10

  Added click and drag zoom to xorbit. Could be cleaned up a bit.

1992-11-12

  Modified event processing loops, handing fo resize, x_is_redraw to
  reduce screen flicker. Reorganized buttons.

1992-11-16

  Fixed bug in widget allocation (useing sec_win for allocation of all
  widgets). Switched hilite_command_in/out to XDrawRectangle since box
  corners weren't meeting with XDrawLine. Removed x_is_remap variable
  and remap_down proc.

1992-11-18

  Cleaned up bottom panel stat display calls. Redraw on panel expose,
  clear totally for orbit display. Modified ships button to cycle
  through showing all/ships only/no ships.

1992-11-23

  Cleaned up GC usage: now only 4, all declared static. Took GC's out
  of map_win. All but but_text_gc use sec_font, so can be used to draw
  maps and orbits instead of old map_win GC's. Started work on input
  editing with positionable cursor.

1992-11-24

  Switched keyboard input handling from keycodes, which are site
  dependent, to KeySym, which should be site-independent. Still do
  explicit check for inclusive printable ascii, which might not be
  okay everywhere.

1992-12-02

  Added cursor positioning in input window using mouse. Cursor
  handling sill a bit kludgy.

1993-01-26  3.1.1

  Began fixing some small bugs in sector updating: now find descriptor
  character in process_xmap_survey so assaulting enemy sectors with
  ships will still display ships if successful. Modified
  sector_update_info to show stats on destination sector for
  move/deploy.

1993-02-05  3.2.0

  Made CSP compliant. Got rid of a bunch of unused stuff. Added nove
  and space mirror arrays to xorbit.

1993-02-07

  Modified button 1 survey request to also issue client_survey to
  update map. Removed dependence on map output, using solely client
  survey, thereby fixing segfault for Jovian maps (IGNORES toggle
  highlight, though).

1993-02-08  3.2.2

  Changed orbit to linked list. Improved orbit scope
  identification. Now only misses planet orbit and a universal orbit
  with such a small zoom that only one star is present.

1993-02-09  3.2.3

  Added numerical zoom input: typing number and clicking zoom button
  zooms in/out the appropriate factor; clicking zoom button with no
  input reverts to original zoom.

1993-11-30  3.2.4

  Made ANSI-compatible. Cleaned up some minor details, tried to
  arrange code more sensibly. Nove and mirror support removed.
