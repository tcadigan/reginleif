Early October I started playing Galactic Bloodshed. On the 17th of that months,
I decided that the client could be made better and I started to write the client
from scratch so that everything would be done a way I understod. By the 20th
(and shortly after my GMAT exam) I had finished the main routines, and proceeded
to add history, recall, and logging. This was released on Ovtober 26, 1990 as
version 1.0.1.

    line. Believe me...much nicer.

    gains keyboard access).
