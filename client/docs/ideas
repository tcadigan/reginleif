MOB "Gar Von Braun" [31,1]: Keesh! It would be a nice idea to fix a command line
do x 22,33,44,20,13 which would do the same as for-sentence but just for those
few ships, not all the range. This would allow people to use 'fleets', defining
a macro to do everything for a little group of ships. A great advancement in
playability!
Other things needed: (dollarsign)# to be the whole line (never tested might be
there) and (never tested either) (latter would be a variable, so every occurance
of (dollarsign)h would be copied ever since...BUT the fleet-idea has been
haunting me for a long time now...Just imagine the possibility to send them to a
certain planet with one command, load stuff in a fleet etc. etc. Just my little
thoughts on bettering GB, Gar Von Braun
