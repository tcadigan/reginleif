MAGIC
=====
Your character may be taught spells by his or her guild or priesthood, at the
collegium magii, or pick them up from a scrol of spells. Every spell costs some
amount of mana to cost. Mana is not normally regenerated except when the player
goes up an experience level, but various magic items augment mana, and the
sorceror's guild will recharge you for a fee. If you learn the same spell
multiple times, the effective power drain to case the spell is lowered. Some
spells have a constant effect, while others vary according to your level. The
spell of ritual magic has a variety of different effects depending on the
circumstances under which it is case. The spell of high magic is the most
powerful, by the way.
