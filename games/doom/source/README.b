Note that the mechanism to detect the
presence of a registered or commercial
version is still in the source, and
homebrew maps are still disabled. This
is easily removed now, but as FinalDOOM,
Ultimate DOOM and DOOM 2 are still in
the shops, it is probably polite not
to distribute a source or binary without
that mechanism.

This version of Linuxdoom supports Plutonia
and TNT WAD from FinalDOOM as well. No
guarantees, though.

Enjoy!
