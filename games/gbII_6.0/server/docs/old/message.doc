12/14/89 - 4 hour updates have started (we changed our minds). 12, 4, 8 am/pm
           PST. there may also be unscheduled updates in case of anything
           unusual that may crop up (hopefully nothing).

12/13/89 - Looks like we got major problems ironed out now. Production is fixed,
           planets now orbit stars by Kepler's Law, and a few other technical
           stuff to improve reliability. You can go ahead and enroll again.

           Also, if you have never played before, when the program asks for your
           password, type the password by which you expect to be referred to of
           by GB. This *is* your password. Please do not enroll more than once,
           we have limited number of openings.

12/12/89 - WELL I LOST THE DATA BASE!! (accidentally used 'rm' instead of 'cp'
           when I was trying to back it up. GRR!!!) Production was messed up
           anyway (unknown, some pointer is mislabeled). I want to make sure
           this is working tonight before we start again. Sorry folks!

12/8/89 - Make sure that your combat ships ('d', 'C', 'B', 'D', '$') have
          resources on board to repair damage! (When these ships are built they
          begin with a 50% damage level). During battle, resources are required
          to be on board to repair ships. Also, make sure you load destruct on
          ships so your guns have ammo to fire. The game automatically loads
          fuel and crew to the max available in a sector. If you don't want that
          unload the crew with 'load' or 'unload' (same thing). Keep in mind
          that the efficiency of the ship depends on the amount of crew
          available (max crew is best!)

12/5/89 - Check out the new options 'aliens', 'geography' and 'inverse'. Do
          'help map' to find out what they do.
            --> I compile these options into one command 'toggle', in
                anticipation of adding tons more later on. -Rob
