These are some ideas expressed by players during the course of a game or
two. I've written them down here as possible future projects.  -Mike

+ Add blackholes to galaxy scope as a galactic obstacle. They're added like
  stars, however, invisible, they suck up a ship when it gets within an
  EVENT_HORIZON radius.

+ Superpod conversion to pod swarm/carrier/cluster; pods are bundled together
  and break into individual pods upon reaching a solar system.

+ Items won on the market should be picked up. 'trader ships'?

+ What's involved in doing an 'order protect fleet'?

+ Read this for some older ideas:

+ Infrastructure machines need serious reworking. For example, we should
  reinstate the atmospheric processor at the very least, and implement some
  limitations on either the number of atoms, or the setting on the atmo (perhaps
  based on the number of sectors a planet has). An idea here is that infs use AP to
  operate instead of resources, and they somehow make planet management easier
  (coordinate atmos, domes, plows, etc.).
  NOTE: This is my current focus (Mike, 09/15/06)

+ Moons. Orbit around planet, no sectors, however a ship can land on it (much
  like landing in a hanger). Obviously we need a LEVEL_MOON, and this is a big
  addition. But what purpose could a moon serve? It should have some value and
  unique properties to make them desireable and interesting, not just a curiosity.

+ Division of game into four phases Exploration, Expansion, Exploitation, and
  Extermination. These phases have no effect on gameplay, they are simple marker
  points to help players judge the process of the game and how far along they are
  in it. For example, the initial phase is Exploration and it moves into
  Expansion once say 80% of the stars or planets have their explored bit set.
