Gladiator version 3.8 Class Information File

This is a list of Character Information by class. It covers all the "standard"
and some non-standard classes. Each class has a short text description, followed
by a brief summary of any special abilities. Some specials will have extra
listing for alternate functions; these functions are accessed by pressing the
'shifter' key in conjunction with the normal special key. Classes or specials
which are marked with an ® in front are only available in the registered version
of Gladiator.

Soldier: Your basic grunt, can absorb and deal damage and moves moderately
         fast. A good all-around fighter. A fighter's normal weapon is a magical
         returning blade. While effective at dealing damage, the downside to
         this is that the fighter must wait for his blade to return before
         throwing it again.
         1.   Charge: The fighter charge is simple but effective. When charging,
                      the fighter runs forward at high speed, dealing damage to
                      anyone he encounters.
         2. ® Boomerang: The boomerang can be difficult to use well, but
                         inflicts much damage. It spirals out from the thrower,
                         inflicting deep wounds on anything it hits. The
                         boomerang can hit multiple targets before falling to
                         Earth.
         3. ® Whirl: When a fighter whirls, he lashes out at all foes within
                     reach. Foes hit by such an attack may be pushed off balance
                     or stunned.
         4. ® Disarm: A skilled fighter can temporarily disarm a nearby
                      opponent. When disarmed, enemies are unable to fight
                      effectively, and often cannot use special abilities.

Barbarian: Barbarians are tough fighters, but posses more will than skill. In
           general, they posses strong constitutions and impressive strength,
           but, lacking the training of the standard Soldiers, tend to bash
           their way through trouble. Barbarians fight with a heavy iron hammer,
           both in melee and ranged combat. One thing which makes Barbarians
           unique is their ability to resist magical attacks. While they bleed
           like any other mortal, magic attacks, more often than not fade off
           their skin without a trace.
           1.   Hurl Boulder: All barbarians have the ability to rip large
                              stones from the nearby ground and hurl them at
                              enemies. How far they can throw them, and the
                              damage the boulders impart, is strongly affected
                              by the strength of the barbarian.
           2.   Exploding Boulder: Using even more energy, a barbarian can hurl
                                   a rock with such strength that it explodes
                                   upon impact, damaging any nearby foes.

Elf: Elves are small and relatively weak, but are harder to hit than most
     classes. Alone of all the standard classes, elves posses the 'ForestWalk'
     ability. This ability allows them to walk through dense forests, passing
     barriers and avoiding enemies. The more dexterous an elf is, the easier she
     will be able to journey through forest land. Elves generally throw stones
     for their ranged attack.
     1.   Rocks: A small handful of rocks.
     2.   Bouncing Rocks: A handful of bouncing rocks.
     3.   Lots of Rocks: An even bigger load of bouncing rocks.
     4.   Mega Rocks: An amazing, huge, load of destructive bouncing rock power!

Archer: Archers are fleet of foot, and their arrows have a long range. Although
        they're not as strong or healthy as fighters, they can also be a good
        squad backbone.
        1.   Fire Arrows: When pressed, a skilled archer can spin quickly
                          around, firing a stream of blazing arrows. Each of
                          these arrows is deadly, and can wreak havoc in crowded
                          quarters.
        2.   Barrage: For when accuracy is more important than total power,
                      archers can loose a stream of arrows all at one target,
                      seriously wounding even the toughest enemy.
        3. ® Exploding Bolt: Unlike the earlier specials, this is merely one
                             bolt, but it packs a lot of punch. Not only does
                             the flaming arrow deal more damage than normal,
                             these bolts explode on impact, damaging friend or
                             foe!

Mage: Mages are slow, nearly defenseless, and horrible at hand-to-hand combat,
      but their magical energy balls pack a big punch. All mages, regardless of
      level, possess the ability to teleport out of (or into!) danger, providing
      they've saved enough magic.
      1.   Teleport: Mages often teleport out of (or into!) danger all over the
                     battlefield. While immensely useful in escaping or
                     exploring, the standard teleport spell is non-directional,
                     and the casting mage has no control over the file
                     destination. SHIFTER: the alternate, more advanced teleport
                     is really a form of 'Dimension Door', and allows the mage
                     to pick a location, memorize it, and return there at
                     will. This skill requires more intelligence than even a
                     normal mage, and the number of uses the memorized spot is
                     also determined by intelligence.
      2.   Warp Space: While Warp Space can be used offensively, it is generally
                       used as a defense by a surrounded mage. Casting this
                       spell will twist the fabric of space around the mage,
                       damaging nearby opponents. the duration and size of the
                       twist are proportional to the amount of magic the mage
                       possesses when the spell is cast.
      3. ® Time Stop: Only powerful mages are able to freeze time at all, let
                      alone for a subjectively long duration. When the spell is
                      cast, time stops for everything not on the mage's
                      team. Although this can be immensely powerful, be warned,
                      as no magic will be generated during this frozen moment.
      4. ® Energy Wave: Somewhat akin to a modern-day flame-thrower, a mage's
                        energy wave releases an enormous, expanding flood of
                        energy outward. The energy wave, being non-corporeal,
                        will pass through walls and other impediments, and can
                        inflict damage on many enemies before fading away.
      5. ® HeartBurst: This awesome spell comes only to the most powerful of
                       mages. By concentrating his own life energies, a mage can
                       send forth an explosive aura of energy, causing nearby
                       foes to burst into flames from their inner depths! The
                       more magic possessed when casting this spell, the
                       stronger the effect will be. The damage is spread among
                       all enemies in range.

ArchMage: When a mage has reached the sixth level or higher, she may choose to
          specialize and become an ArchMage. An ArchMage takes the learnings of
          the Magi one step further, possessing extraordinary firepower at the
          expense of physical weakness. Even more than for a normal Mage, an
          ArchMage's powers all hinge upon how much Intelligence is
          possessed. An ArchMage shares some spells with the standard Mage
          class, but quickly gains other spells for high damage.
          1.   Teleport: Like normal mages, ArchMages possess the ability to
                         teleport into and out of danger. Similarly, intelligent
                         ArchMages can use the alternate form of this ability
                         (SHIFTER) to place a marker, so as to memorize a
                         location to return to.
          2. ® HeartBurst: This spell is a more powerful version of the standard
                           mage's HeartBurst (5th level), and functions in the
                           same manner. SHIFTER: By using the alternate version
                           of an ArchMage's second-level ability, the spell
                           'Chain Lightning' is called forth. Here, the ArchMage
                           shoots out a bolt of lightning, powered by excess
                           mana. The bolt will seek out a nearby enemy, and upon
                           impact, split into multiple new bolts, which will
                           seek their own targets. In crowded quarters, this
                           spell can incinerate an entire room of the foe with
                           one continuous blast!
          3.   Summon Image: By means of an intricate yet relatively inexpensive
                             spell, an ArchMage can summon forth an image of a
                             brave warrior to fight for his team. Should the
                             enemy accept the illusion as real, this phantom can
                             inflict real damage upon the foe. Once pricked by
                             the point of any weapon, however, the illusion will
                             vanish back into the ether. SHIFTER: More powerful
                             than illusion, a strong ArchMage may summon forth
                             an elemental of fire. This spell, however, comes
                             with both a blessing and a curse -- for the
                             lifeforce of this elemental is linked to that of
                             the ArchMage, and while this may infuse the demon
                             with extra sustaining health, it can also weaken
                             the ArchMage to a perilous condition!
          4.   Mind Control: For a short time, powerful ArchMages may control
                             the minds of those around them, bending their
                             enemies to their will. The more magical energy the
                             ArchMage has available, the stronger the control
                             will be, and the greater number of foes will be
                             enslaved.

Cleric: Clerics, like mages, are slow but have a stronger hand-to-hand
        attack. Clerics posses abilities related to healing and, on the darker
        side, interaction with the dead. Clerics have the unique ability to
        generate fields which their teammates can pass through, but which foes
        must hack down to pass.
        1.   Heal: Even the lowest cleric possesses the gods-granted ability to
                   heal others. Due to the nature of this gift, a cleric can
                   heal several friends, if gathered closely around, for the
                   mana cost of a single spell. The higher level a cleric is,
                   the stronger this healing power will become. NOTE: Clerics
                   controlled by the computer who are on your team will
                   automatically attempt to heal any wounded team member who
                   'bumps' them. SHIFTER: Although normally beings of peace,
                   even Clerics sometimes need a strong defense to keep their
                   lifeblood flowing. Thus, every Cleric soon learns the 'Mystic
                   Mace' spell, which conjurs an ethereal mace to defend against
                   blows, and strike any foe who gets too close. Although
                   several of these 'maces' may be summoned at one time, the
                   strength of each is determined by the amount of magical
                   energy put into it, and thus one strong mace may be more
                   effective than several weaker ones.
        2.   Raise Undead: This clerical ability allows the caster to
                           temporarily bring back fallen foes or friends, and
                           have them fight once more. The strength of this
                           recalled zombie, as well as its duration upon the
                           battlefield, depends both on the cleric's power and
                           the strength of the one who is raised. When the
                           undead falls again, no power available can bring it
                           back. SHIFTER: The reverse of raise undead, Turn
                           Undead has the power to ultimately send the walking
                           dead back to their realm.
        3.   Raise Ghost: This stronger version of Raise Undead brings back not
                          the bodies of those who have fallen, but the
                          spirit. Such a ghost has the advantage of being
                          ethereal and traveling anywhere, as well as possessing
                          stronger powers of attack than a mere zombie. SHIFTER:
                          As with Raise Undead, a knowledgeable cleric has the
                          power not only to bring forth spirits, but also to lay
                          them to rest. This level of Turn Undead will affect
                          both zombies and ethereal spirits.
        4. ® Resurrect: This ultimate power of the clerics puts the art of
                        raising the dead to shame. With this spell, a powerful
                        cleric can reunite the body and soul of a fallen
                        comrade, healing most wounds in the process. Be warned,
                        however, that such an endeavor is extremely taxing to
                        both the one who is raised and the casting cleric.

Thief: Thieves are fast and stronger of constitution than the magic-wielders,
       though not so potent as the soldier. Like fighters, thieves wield
       stabbing and throwing blades. Although their blades are not magical, the
       posses an unlimited supply and can throw them in rapid succession.
       1.   Plant Bomb: All thieves can drop small, hand-made explosives to the
                        ground, often able to take out even the strongest
                        opponent. Beware, however, for unlike an archer's
                        arrows, bombs do not discriminate in who they destroy!
       2. ® Cloak: A moderately experienced thief can learn to hide in even the
                   smallest shadows, slipping unseen past enemy patrols. How
                   good the 'cloaking' is, and how long the thief can maintain
                   it, depends on both the dexterity and level of the
                   practicer. A thief on your team who is cloaked will show up
                   with an outline, so that you know where she is.
       3. ® Taunt: While some would think it insane, thieves have made an art of
                   taunting their enemies. A skilled thief can lure her enemies
                   away from their chosen targets, often leading them on a
                   fruitless chase, until the rest of the team can wipe them
                   up. SHIFTER: When not taunting their enemies, thieves may be
                   charming them instead. Masters of inducing paranoia and
                   charm, a clever thief can at times convince his worst enemy
                   to help him out for a while.
       4. ® Poison Cloud: The ability to create billowing clouds of poison is
                          the thief's other offensive weapon. By gathering up
                          harmless elements and combining them, a thief can
                          create a truly noxious concoction, which when smashed
                          from its container will quickly expand into the air,
                          bringing airborne pain and confusion to nearby
                          enemies.

Druid: Druids are the magicians of nature, and have special powers over natural
       events. Druids can throw lightning bolts at their foes; the bolts have
       long range and are very fast.
       1.   Grow Tree: The simplest druid magic is that of planting and growing
                       trees. While this might seem pointless, the druid imbues
                       these saplings with is own energy, and the trees will
                       allow friends to pass without hindrance, but severely
                       impede any enemies trying to slip past.
       2.   Summon: The druid power to summon forth sprites and faeries from the
                    woodlands is well known. These summoned sprites will take
                    off in pursuit of enemies, flying over the landscape and
                    freezing foes in their tracks.
       3. ® Reveal Items: The druid's power to magically reveal items to his
                          sight most often used when searching for gold or other
                          treasure. At other times, this sight aids in searching
                          out enemy encampments or fortifications. When Reveal
                          is cast, gold silver, potions and creature generators
                          will show up in the radar map, but only to the
                          caster.

® Orc: Orcs are your basic 'grunt' fighter; strong and hard to hurt, but without
       much intelligence or ability to do more than inflict pain. Basic orcs
       don't have a ranged attack, but their damage at close range is
       impressive.
       1.   Howl: An orc's howl of rage has an almost magical quality about
                  it. Those nearby are often stunned, unable to move of defend
                  themselves. How long this effect lasts depends on the distance
                  between the orc and its foe and their respective levels.
       2.   Eat Corpse: Other members of the team tend to ignore the orc's
                        ability of eating the corpses of the enemy (and
                        sometimes friend). Nevertheless, the strength and power
                        gained by this barbarous act cannot be denied.

® Fire Elemental: Fire elementals have been known to strike terror into even the
                  toughest of warriors. Strong and relatively quick, their
                  flaming meteors can inflict hideous wounds upon an enemy, and
                  their speed can size make them dangerous opponents even
                  without this ability.
                  1.   Starburst: Fire elementals have the ability to release a
                                  'starburst' of flaming death in all
                                  directions; this natural defense will
                                  sometimes destroy an enemy even as the fire
                                  elemental itself perishes.

® Skeleton: Skeletons are the pathetic remains of those who once were among the
            living. Although they are not particularly dangerous, they move with
            blinding speed, and often surround a living enemy to take it to the
            grave.
            1.   Tunnel: These bone-wielding undead have the ability to tunnel
                         quickly underground, sometimes emerging under their
                         hapless victim's feet. When manipulated by an
                         intelligent mind, this ability also allows them to
                         tunnel under walls and come at the enemy from the
                         rear.

® Ghost: A more fearsome type of undead, ghosts can pass through walls, trees,
         and anything else that gets in their way. Although they cannot inflict
         damage from a distance, their chilling touch can bring death quickly at
         close range.
         1.   Scare: A ghost's haunting wail can cause even the bravest of
                     warriors to flee in terror. When invoked, all nearby
                     enemies will flee away from the ghost; how far they run,
                     and how long the effect lasts, is determined by the power
                     of the ghost and the resistance of the targets.

® Faerie: The flying faerie are diminutive in stature, flying above friends and
          enemies alike unnoticed. Although they are delicate and easily
          destroyed, faeries can sprinkle magic powder which can freeze their
          enemies in place.

® Slime: It is hard to say if a slime is truly intelligent, or simply some form
         of lichen too agitated to remain still. Although generally peaceful in
         nature, slimes can make dangerous enemies when disturbed. From what has
         been observed of slimes, they begin life as small, relatively harmless
         patches of ooze which grow until they are bigger than a man. These
         large patches of slime then split into two or more small slimes, thus
         increasing the population. Slimes are particularly vulnerable to fire
         or magical attacks.
         1.   Grow: Slimes can grow larger, or split in two, when they gain
                    enough magical energy.
